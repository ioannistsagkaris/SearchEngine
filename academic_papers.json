        "Abstract": "In recent years, with the maturation of large language model (LLM) technology and the emergence of high-quality programming code datasets, researchers have become increasingly confident in addressing the challenges of program synthesis automatically. However, since most of the training samples for LLMs are unscreened, it is inevitable that LLMs' performance may not align with real-world scenarios, leading to the presence of social bias. To evaluate and quantify the gender bias in code LLMs, we propose a dataset named CodeGenBias (Gender Bias in the Code Generation) and an evaluation metric called FB-Score (Factual Bias Score) based on the actual gender distribution of correlative professions. With the help of CodeGenBias and FB-Score, we evaluate and analyze the gender bias in eight mainstream Code LLMs. Previous work has demonstrated that model editing methods that perform well in knowledge editing have the potential to mitigate social bias in LLMs. Therefore, we develop a model editing approach named MG-Editing (Multi-Granularity model Editing), which includes the locating and editing phases. Our model editing method MG-Editing can be applied at five different levels of model parameter granularity: full parameters level, layer level, module level, row level, and neuron level. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate that our MG-Editing can effectively mitigate the gender bias in code LLMs while maintaining their general code generation capabilities, but also showcase its excellent generalization. At the same time, the experimental results show that, considering both the gender bias of the model and its general code generation capability, MG-Editing is most effective when applied at the row and neuron levels of granularity.",

        "Abstract": "High-level synthesis (HLS) allows hardware designers to create hardware designs with high-level programming languages like C/C++/OpenCL, which greatly improves hardware design productivity. However, existing HLS flows require programmers' hardware design expertise and rely on programmers' manual code transformations and directive annotations to guide compiler optimizations. Optimizing HLS designs requires non-trivial HLS expertise and tedious iterative process in HLS code optimization. Automating HLS code optimizations has become a burning need. Recently, large language models (LLMs) trained on massive code and programming tasks have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in comprehending code, showing the ability to handle domain-specific programming queries directly without labor-intensive fine-tuning. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented LLM-based approach to effectively optimize high-level synthesis (HLS) programs. Our proposed method leverages few-shot learning, enabling large language models to adopt domain-specific knowledge through natural language prompts. We propose a unique framework, Retrieve Augmented Large Language Model Aided Design (RALAD), designed to enhance LLMs' performance in HLS code optimization tasks. RALAD employs advanced embedding techniques and top-\\emph{k} search algorithms to dynamically source relevant knowledge from extensive databases, thereby providing contextually appropriate responses to complex programming queries. Our implementation of RALAD on two specialized domains, utilizing comparatively smaller language models, achieves an impressive 80\\% success rate in compilation tasks and outperforms general LLMs by 3.7 -- 19$\\times$ in latency improvement.",

        "Abstract": "In the world of linear algebra computation, a well-established standard exists called BLAS(Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms). This standard has been crucial for the development of software using linear algebra operations. Its benefits include portability with efficiency and mitigation of suboptimal re-implementations of linear algebra operations. Multilinear algebra is an extension of linear algebra in which the central objects are tensors, which are generalizations of vectors and matrices. Though tensor operations are becoming more common, they do not have a standard like BLAS. Such standardization would be beneficial and decrease the now-visible replication of work, as many libraries nowadays use their own implementations. This master thesis aims to work towards such a standard by discovering whether or not a BLAS-like interface is possible for the operation binary tensor contraction. To answer this, an interface has been developed in the programming language C together with an implementation and tested to see if it would be sufficient. The interface developed is:\n  xGETT(RANKA, EXTA, INCA, A, RANKB, EXTB, INCB, B, CONTS, CONTA, CONTB, PERM, INCC, C)\n  with the implementation and tests, it has been deemed sufficient as a BLAS-like interface for binary tensor contractions and possible to use in a BLAS-like standardization for tensor operations.",

Prior research indicates that LLMs pre-trained with programming language data exhibit high mathematical and reasoning abilities; however, this causal relationship has not been rigorously tested. Our research aims to verify which programming languages and features during pre-training affect logical inference performance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from scratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) and three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical conditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot in-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do not require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly all models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those trained with natural languages, indicating that programming languages contain factors that elicit logic inference performance. In addition, we found that models trained with programming languages exhibit a better ability to follow instructions compared to those trained with natural languages. Further analysis reveals that the depth of Abstract Syntax Trees representing parsed results of programs also affects logical reasoning performance. These findings will offer insights into the essential elements of pre-training for acquiring the foundational abilities of LLMs.",

We expand the scope of LLMs' capabilities to a broader context, using LLMs to execute code snippets to obtain the output. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs as code executors, where code snippets are directly fed to the models for execution, and outputs are returned. We are the first to comprehensively examine this feasibility across various LLMs, including OpenAI's o1, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder. Notably, the o1 model achieved over 90% accuracy in code execution, while others demonstrated lower accuracy levels. Furthermore, we introduce an Iterative Instruction Prompting (IIP) technique that processes code snippets line by line, enhancing the accuracy of weaker models by an average of 7.22% (with the highest improvement of 18.96%) and an absolute average improvement of 3.86% against CoT prompting (with the highest improvement of 19.46%). Our study not only highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in coding but also lays the groundwork for future advancements in automated programming and the completion of complex tasks.",

We propose to extend this powerful combination to the control of dynamical systems, generating interpretable control policies capable of complex behaviors. With our novel method, we represent control policies as programs in standard languages like Python. We evaluate candidate controllers in simulation and evolve them using a pre-trained LLM. Unlike conventional learning-based control techniques, which rely on black box neural networks to encode control policies, our approach enhances transparency and interpretability. We still take advantage of the power of large AI models, but leverage it at the policy design phase, ensuring that all system components remain interpretable and easily verifiable at runtime. Additionally, the use of standard programming languages makes it straightforward for humans to finetune or adapt the controllers based on their expertise and intuition. We illustrate our method through its application to the synthesis of an interpretable control policy for the pendulum swing-up and the ball in cup tasks.

        "Abstract": "Autonomous systems for software engineering are now capable of fixing bugs and developing features. These systems are commonly evaluated on SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024a), which assesses their ability to solve software issues from GitHub repositories. However, SWE-bench uses only Python repositories, with problem statements presented predominantly as text and lacking visual elements such as images. This limited coverage motivates our inquiry into how existing systems might perform on unrepresented software engineering domains (e.g., front-end, game development, DevOps), which use different programming languages and paradigms. Therefore, we propose SWE-bench Multimodal (SWE-bench M), to evaluate systems on their ability to fix bugs in visual, user-facing JavaScript software. SWE-bench M features 617 task instances collected from 17 JavaScript libraries used for web interface design, diagramming, data visualization, syntax highlighting, and interactive mapping. Each SWE-bench M task instance contains at least one image in its problem statement or unit tests. Our analysis finds that top-performing SWE-bench systems struggle with SWE-bench M, revealing limitations in visual problem-solving and cross-language generalization. Lastly, we show that SWE-agent's flexible language-agnostic features enable it to substantially outperform alternatives on SWE-bench M, resolving 12% of task instances compared to 6% for the next best system.",

This bottom-up approach can be frustrating for novices, shifting the focus away from problem solving and potentially making computing less appealing to a broad range of students. The rise of generative AI for code production could partially address these issues by fostering new skills via interaction with AI models, including constructing high-level prompts and evaluating code that is automatically generated. In this experience report, we explore the inclusion of two prompt-focused activities in an introductory course, implemented across four labs in a six-week module. The first requires students to solve computational problems by writing natural language prompts, emphasizing problem-solving over syntax. The second involves students crafting prompts to generate code equivalent to provided fragments, to foster an understanding of the relationship between prompts and code. Most of the students in the course had reported finding programming difficult to learn, often citing frustrations with syntax and debugging. We found that self-reported difficulty with learning programming had a strong inverse relationship with performance on traditional programming assessments such as tests and projects, as expected. However, performance on the natural language tasks was less strongly related to self-reported difficulty, suggesting they may target different skills. Learning how to communicate with AI coding models is becoming an important skill, and natural language prompting tasks may appeal to a broad range of students.",

To further improve the performance of LLMs on specific code intelligence tasks and reduce training costs, researchers reveal a new capability of LLMs: in-context learning (ICL). ICL allows LLMs to learn from a few demonstrations within a specific context, achieving impressive results without parameter updating. However, the rise of ICL introduces new security vulnerabilities in the code intelligence field. In this paper, we explore a novel security scenario based on the ICL paradigm, where attackers act as third-party ICL agencies and provide users with bad ICL content to mislead LLMs outputs in code intelligence tasks. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and risks of such a scenario, revealing how attackers can leverage malicious demonstrations to construct bad ICL content and induce LLMs to produce incorrect outputs, posing significant threats to system security. We propose a novel method to construct bad ICL content called DICE, which is composed of two stages: Demonstration Selection and Bad ICL Construction, constructing targeted bad ICL content based on the user query and transferable across different query inputs. Ultimately, our findings emphasize the critical importance of securing ICL mechanisms to protect code intelligence systems from adversarial manipulation.",

The algorithm is scripted in the CUDA programming language in order to speed up the calculations and obtain results in a relatively short time frame by using a graphics processing unit (GPU). Our results show a speedup higher than 50X for vector size of $2^{14}$ in comparison with the analogous code scripted for running only in CPU. The package implements the CWEs to model the propagation of light in second-order nonlinear crystals widely used in optical frequency conversion experiments. In addition, the code allows the user to adapt the cavity configuration by selecting the resonant electric fields and/or incorporating intracavity elements.

Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.",

PARSIR is a compile/run-time environment for discrete event simulation models developed with the {\\tt C} programming language. The architecture of PARSIR has been designed in order to keep low the amount of CPU-cycles required for running models. This is achieved via the combination of a set of techniques like: 1) causally consistent batch-processing of simulation events at an individual simulation object for caching effectiveness; 2) high likelihood of disjoint access parallelism; 3) the favoring of memory accesses on local NUMA (Non-Uniform-Memory-Access) nodes in the architecture, while still enabling well balanced workload distribution via work-stealing from remote nodes; 4) the use of RMW (Read-Modify-Write) machine instructions for fast access to simulation engine data required by the worker threads for managing the concurrent simulation objects and distributing the workload. Furthermore, any architectural solution embedded in the PARSIR engine is fully transparent to the application level code implementing the simulation model. We also provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of PARSIR when running the reference PHOLD benchmark on a NUMA shared-memory multi-processor machine equipped with 40 CPUs.",

The advantage of Chebyshev series is that they are naturally adapted to spaces of real analytic functions, in the sense that they converge on ellipses containing real intervals rather than on disks in $\\mathbb{C}$. The main disadvantage of working with Chebyshev series in this context is that the essential operations of rescaling and composition are less straight forward for Chebysehv than for Taylor series. These difficulties are overcome using a combination of a-priori information about decay rates in the Banach space with a-posteriori estimates on Chebyshev interpolation errors for analytic functions.\n  Our arguments are implemented in the Julia programming language and exploit extended precision floating point interval arithmetic. In addition to proving the existence of multiple renormalization fixed points of order $m = 3, \\ldots, 10$, and computing validated bounds on the values of their the universal constants, we also reprove the existence of the classical $m=2$ Feigenbaum renormalization fixed point and compute its universal constants to close to 500 correct decimal digits.",

However, despite the advancements in edge computing, significant challenges remain in efficient training and deploying LLMs due to the computational demands and data privacy concerns associated with these models. This paper explores a collaborative training framework that integrates mobile users with edge servers to optimize resource allocation, thereby enhancing both performance and efficiency. Our approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, allowing mobile users to adjust the initial layers of the LLM while edge servers handle the more demanding latter layers. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption and delay during training. We also address the common issue of instability in model performance by incorporating stability enhancements into our objective function. Through novel fractional programming technique, we achieve a stationary point for the formulated problem. Simulations demonstrate that our method reduces the energy consumption as well as the latency, and increases the reliability of LLMs across various mobile settings.",

Compared to high-level languages, intermediate representations such as bytecode offer a much more limited and stable set of features; hence, they may help decouple the verification process from changes in the source-level language.\n  ByteBack offers a library to specify functional correctness properties at the level of the source code, so that the bytecode is only used as an intermediate representation that the end user does not need to work with. Then, ByteBack reconstructs some of the information about types and expressions that is erased during compilation into bytecode but is necessary to correctly perform verification. Our experiments with an implementation of ByteBack demonstrate that it can successfully verify bytecode compiled from different versions of Java, and including several modern language features that even state-of-the-art Java verifiers (such as KeY and OpenJML) do not directly support$\\unicode{x2013}$thus revealing how ByteBack's approach can help keep up verification technology with language evolution.",

        "Abstract": "A program's exceptional behavior can substantially complicate its control flow, and hence accurately reasoning about the program's correctness. On the other hand, formally verifying realistic programs is likely to involve exceptions -- a ubiquitous feature in modern programming languages.\n  In this paper, we present a novel approach to verify the exceptional behavior of Java programs, which extends our previous work on ByteBack. ByteBack works on a program's bytecode, while providing means to specify the intended behavior at the source-code level; this approach sets ByteBack apart from most state-of-the-art verifiers that target source code. To explicitly model a program's exceptional behavior in a way that is amenable to formal reasoning, we introduce Vimp: a high-level bytecode representation that extends the Soot framework's Grimp with verification-oriented features, thus serving as an intermediate layer between bytecode and the Boogie intermediate verification language. Working on bytecode through this intermediate layer brings flexibility and adaptability to new language versions and variants: as our experiments demonstrate, ByteBack can verify programs involving exceptional behavior in all versions of Java, as well as in Scala and Kotlin (two other popular JVM languages).",

        "Abstract": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has become a crucial paradigm for managing the growing complexity of modern software systems, particularly in fields like machine learning, deep learning, large language models (LLM), and data analytics. This work provides a comprehensive introduction to the integration of OOP techniques within these domains, with a focus on improving code modularity, maintainability, and scalability. We begin by outlining the evolution of computing and the rise of OOP, followed by an in-depth discussion of key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The practical application of these principles is demonstrated using Python, a widely adopted language in AI and data science. Furthermore, we examine how design patterns and modular programming can be employed to enhance the structure and efficiency of machine learning systems. In subsequent sections, we apply these OOP concepts to real-world AI tasks, including the encapsulation of preprocessing workflows, machine learning model training, and evaluation. Detailed examples illustrate how OOP can be used to build reusable, scalable machine learning systems while maintaining code clarity and reducing redundancy.This work is intended to serve as a bridge for both beginners and experienced developers, equipping them with the necessary knowledge to apply OOP methodologies in AI-driven projects, ultimately fostering the development of more robust and maintainable systems.",

        "Abstract": "The need to analyze graphs is ubiquitous across various fields, from social networks to biological research and recommendation systems. Therefore, enabling the ability of large language models (LLMs) to process graphs is an important step toward more advanced general intelligence. However, current LLM benchmarks on graph analysis require models to directly reason over the prompts describing graph topology, and are thus limited to small graphs with only a few dozens of nodes. In contrast, human experts typically write programs based on popular libraries for task solving, and can thus handle graphs with different scales. To this end, a question naturally arises: can LLMs analyze graphs like professionals? In this paper, we introduce ProGraph, a manually crafted benchmark containing 3 categories of graph tasks. The benchmark expects solutions based on programming instead of directly reasoning over raw inputs. Our findings reveal that the performance of current LLMs is unsatisfactory, with the best model achieving only 36% accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose LLM4Graph datasets, which include crawled documents and auto-generated codes based on 6 widely used graph libraries. By augmenting closed-source LLMs with document retrieval and fine-tuning open-source ones on the codes, we show 11-32% absolute improvements in their accuracies. Our results underscore that the capabilities of LLMs in handling structured data are still under-explored, and show the effectiveness of LLM4Graph in enhancing LLMs' proficiency of graph analysis. The benchmark, datasets and enhanced open-source models are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/ProGraph.",

        "Abstract": "Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial pseudomonads $(u,1,Σ)$ with extra structure (termed \"natural models\" by Awodey) hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the category of polynomial functors in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models of type theory.\n  This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them \\emph{entirely} in the language of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors internally in the language of Homotopy Type Theory, which allows for higher-dimensional structures such as pseudomonads, etc. to be expressed purely in terms of the structure of a suitably-chosen $\\infty$-category of polynomial functors. The move from set theory to Homotopy Type Theory thus has a twofold effect of enabling a simpler exposition of natural models, which is at the same time amenable to formalization in a proof assistant, such as Agda.\n  Moreover, the choice to remain firmly within the setting of polynomial functors reveals many additional structures of natural models that were otherwise left implicit or not considered by Awodey \\& Newstead. Chief among these, we highlight the fact that every polynomial pseudomonad $(u,1,Σ)$ as above that is also equipped with structure to interpret dependent product types gives rise to a self-distributive law $u \\triangleleft u\\to u \\triangleleft u$, which witnesses the usual distributive law of dependent products over dependent sums.",

Understanding quantum algorithms requires knowledge of physics and mathematics, which can be challenging for software developers.\n  Aims: In this work, we provide a first analysis of how LLMs can support developers' understanding of quantum code. Method: We empirically analyse and compare the quality of explanations provided by three widely adopted LLMs (Gpt3.5, Llama2, and Tinyllama) using two different human-written prompt styles for seven state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. We also analyse how consistent LLM explanations are over multiple rounds and how LLMs can improve existing descriptions of quantum algorithms.\n  Results: Llama2 provides the highest quality explanations from scratch, while Gpt3.5 emerged as the LLM best suited to improve existing explanations. In addition, we show that adding a small amount of context to the prompt significantly improves the quality of explanations. Finally, we observe how explanations are qualitatively and syntactically consistent over multiple rounds.\n  Conclusions: This work highlights promising results, and opens challenges for future research in the field of LLMs for quantum code explanation. Future work includes refining the methods through prompt optimisation and parsing of quantum code explanations, as well as carrying out a systematic assessment of the quality of explanations.",

LLMs have been shown to excel at producing correct code to CS1 and CS2 problems, and can even act as friendly assistants to students learning how to code. Recent work shows that LLMs demonstrate unequivocally superior results in being able to explain and resolve compiler error messages -- for decades, one of the most frustrating parts of learning how to code. However, LLM-generated error message explanations have only been assessed by expert programmers in artificial conditions. This work sought to understand how novice programmers resolve programming error messages (PEMs) in a more realistic scenario. We ran a within-subjects study with $n$ = 106 participants in which students were tasked to fix six buggy C programs. For each program, participants were randomly assigned to fix the problem using either a stock compiler error message, an expert-handwritten error message, or an error message explanation generated by GPT-4. Despite promising evidence on synthetic benchmarks, we found that GPT-4 generated error messages outperformed conventional compiler error messages in only 1 of the 6 tasks, measured by students' time-to-fix each problem. Handwritten explanations still outperform LLM and conventional error messages, both on objective and subjective measures.",

        "Abstract": "A memory consistency model specifies the allowed behaviors of shared memory concurrent programs. At the language level, these models are known to have a non-trivial impact on the safety of program optimizations, limiting the ability to rearrange/refactor code without introducing new behaviors. Existing programming language memory models try to address this by permitting more (relaxed/weak) concurrent behaviors but are still unable to allow all the desired optimizations. A core problem is that weaker consistency models may also render optimizations unsafe, a conclusion that goes against the intuition of them allowing more behaviors. This exposes an open problem of the compositional interaction between memory consistency semantics and optimizations: which parts of the semantics correspond to allowing/disallowing which set of optimizations is unclear. In this work, we establish a formal foundation suitable enough to understand this compositional nature, decomposing optimizations into a finite set of elementary effects on program execution traces, over which aspects of safety can be assessed. We use this decomposition to identify a desirable compositional property (complete) that would guarantee the safety of optimizations from one memory model to another. We showcase its practicality by proving such a property between Sequential Consistency (SC) and $SC_{RR}$, the latter allowing independent read-read reordering over $SC$. Our work potentially paves way to a new design methodology of programming-language memory models, one that places emphasis on the optimizations desired to be performed.",

To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).",

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation by generating more natural and safer code than rule-based methods, previous studies have shown that LLM-generated Rust code often fails to compile, even for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM-based translation scheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1) pre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid exceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using context-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding 4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.",

The proposed adapter was trained using a large and diverse dataset, including question-answer pairs related to programming, as well code-related texts in Russian language. The applied training methodology ensures an improvement in the model's quality of answers in understanding and generating Python code based on Russian instructions. We evaluated the performance of the base model with the installed adapter using various metrics, comparing it to the base model as well as other state-of-the-art models in this field.

This content included detailed descriptions of individual OpenMP constructs and practical programming examples. The outline and content have then undergone extensive manual revisions to meet our book goals. In this paper, we report our findings about the capabilities and limitations of these LLMs. We address critical questions concerning the necessity of textbook resources and the effectiveness of LLMs in creating fundamental and practical programming content. Our findings suggest that while LLMs offer significant advantages in generating textbook content, they require careful integration with traditional educational methodologies to ensure depth, accuracy, and pedagogical effectiveness. The Interactive OpenMP Programming book is developed with the framework of Jupyter Book, enabling the execution of code within the book from the web browser, providing instant feedback and a dynamic learning experience that stands in contrast to traditional educational resources.

As C/C++ comprises half of the Open-Source Software (OSS) vulnerabilities over the past decade and updates in OSS mainly occur through commits, enhancing LLMs' ability to identify C/C++ Vulnerability-Contributing Commits (VCCs) is essential. However, current studies primarily focus on further pre-training LLMs on massive code datasets, which is resource-intensive and poses efficiency challenges. In this paper, we enhance the ability of BERT-based LLMs to identify C/C++ VCCs in a lightweight manner. We propose CodeLinguaNexus (CLNX) as a bridge facilitating communication between C/C++ programs and LLMs. Based on commits, CLNX efficiently converts the source code into a more natural representation while preserving key details. Specifically, CLNX first applies structure-level naturalization to decompose complex programs, followed by token-level naturalization to interpret complex symbols. We evaluate CLNX on public datasets of 25,872 C/C++ functions with their commits. The results show that CLNX significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on identifying C/C++ VCCs. Moreover, CLNX-equipped CodeBERT achieves new state-of-the-art and identifies 38 OSS vulnerabilities in the real world.",

We describe the foundational aspects necessary for such a system, including the identification of key generative elements (primitive, animation, and interaction) and design requirements to enhance user interaction, based on formative exploration and iterative design processes. Based on these insights, we develop SHAPE-IT, an LLM-based authoring tool for a 24 x 24 shape display, which translates the user's textual command into executable code and allows for quick exploration through a web-based control interface. We evaluate the effectiveness of SHAPE-IT in two ways: 1) performance evaluation and 2) user evaluation (N= 10). The study conclusions highlight the ability to facilitate rapid ideation of a wide range of shape-changing behaviors with AI.

In an empirical study, we feed prompts with textual descriptions of coding problems sourced from the programming website LeetCode to the models with the task of creating solutions in Python. Subsequently, the quality of the generated outputs is assessed using the testing functionalities of LeetCode. The results indicate large differences in performance between the investigated models. ChatGPT can handle these typical programming challenges by far the most effectively, surpassing even code-specialized models like Code Llama. To gain further insights, we measure the runtime as well as the memory usage of the generated outputs and compared them to the other code submissions on Leetcode. A detailed error analysis, encompassing a comparison of the differences concerning correct indentation and form of the generated code as well as an assignment of the incorrectly solved tasks to certain error categories allows us to obtain a more nuanced picture of the results and potential for improvement. The results also show a clear pattern of increasingly incorrect produced code when the models are facing a lot of context in the form of longer prompts.",

To advance automatic programming, researchers are focusing on three primary directions: (1) code search that reuses existing code snippets from external databases; (2) code generation that produces new code snippets from natural language; and (3) program repair that refines existing code snippets by fixing detected bugs. Despite significant advancements, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art techniques is still limited, such as the usability of searched code and the correctness of generated code.\n  Motivated by the real-world programming process, where developers usually use various external tools to aid their coding processes, such as code search engines and code testing tools, in this work, we propose \\toolname{}, an automatic programming framework that leverages recent large language models (LLMs) to integrate the three research areas to address their inherent limitations. In particular, our framework first leverages different code search strategies to retrieve similar code snippets, which are then used to further guide the code generation process of LLMs. Our framework further validates the quality of generated code by compilers and test cases, and constructs repair prompts to query LLMs for generating correct patches. We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of our framework, \\eg helping CodeLlama solve 267 programming problems with an improvement of 62.53\\%. As a generic framework, \\toolname{} can integrate various code search, generation, and repair tools, combining these three research areas together for the first time.

Developers dedicate substantial time to writing tests for validating an application and preventing regressions. To support developers in this task, software engineering research over the past few decades has developed many techniques for automating unit test generation. However, despite this effort, usable tools exist for very few programming languages -- mainly Java, C, and C# and, more recently, for Python. Moreover, studies have found that automatically generated tests suffer poor readability and often do not resemble developer-written tests. In this work, we present a rigorous investigation of how large language models (LLMs) can help bridge the gap. We describe a generic pipeline that incorporates static analysis to guide LLMs in generating compilable and high-coverage test cases. We illustrate how the pipeline can be applied to different programming languages, specifically Java and Python, and to complex software requiring environment mocking. We conducted a through empirical study to assess the quality of the generated tests in terms of coverage, mutation score, and test naturalness -- evaluating them on standard as well as enterprise Java applications and a large Python benchmark. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based test generation, when guided by static analysis, can be competitive with, and even outperform, state-of-the-art test-generation techniques in coverage achieved while also producing considerably more natural test cases that developers find easy to read and understand. We also present the results of a user study, conducted with 161 professional developers, that highlights the naturalness characteristics of the tests generated by our approach.",

        "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of program synthesis. However, contemporary LLM-based code completion systems often hallucinate broken code because they lack appropriate context, particularly when working with definitions not in the training data nor near the cursor. This paper demonstrates that tight integration with the type and binding structure of a language, as exposed by its language server, can address this contextualization problem in a token-efficient manner. In short, we contend that AIs need IDEs, too! In particular, we integrate LLM code generation into the Hazel live program sketching environment. The Hazel Language Server identifies the type and typing context of the hole being filled, even in the presence of errors, ensuring that a meaningful program sketch is always available. This allows prompting with codebase-wide contextual information not lexically local to the cursor, nor necessarily in the same file, but that is likely to be semantically local to the developer's goal. Completions synthesized by the LLM are then iteratively refined via further dialog with the language server. To evaluate these techniques, we introduce MVUBench, a dataset of model-view-update (MVU) web applications. These applications serve as challenge problems due to their reliance on application-specific data structures. We find that contextualization with type definitions is particularly impactful. After introducing our ideas in the context of Hazel we duplicate our techniques and port MVUBench to TypeScript in order to validate the applicability of these methods to higher-resource languages. Finally, we outline ChatLSP, a conservative extension to the Language Server Protocol (LSP) that language servers can implement to expose capabilities that AI code completion systems of various designs can use to incorporate static context when generating prompts for an LLM.",

These languages are designed to be accessible to users with limited coding experience, allowing them to achieve creative output without an extensive programming background. Using LLM-based code generation to further lower the barrier to creative output is an exciting opportunity. However, the best strategy for code generation for visual node-based programming languages is still an open question. In particular, such languages have multiple levels of representation in text, each of which may be used for code generation. In this work, we explore the performance of LLM code generation in audio programming tasks in visual programming languages at multiple levels of representation. We explore code generation through metaprogramming code representations for these languages (i.e., coding the language using a different high-level text-based programming language), as well as through direct node generation with JSON. We evaluate code generated in this way for two visual languages for audio programming on a benchmark set of coding problems. We measure both correctness and complexity of the generated code. We find that metaprogramming results in more semantically correct generated code, given that the code is well-formed (i.e., is syntactically correct and runs). We also find that prompting for richer metaprogramming using randomness and loops led to more complex code.",

        "Abstract": "In top-down enumeration for program synthesis, abstraction-based pruning uses an abstract domain to approximate the set of possible values that a partial program, when completed, can output on a given input. If the set does not contain the desired output, the partial program and all its possible completions can be pruned. In its general form, abstraction-based pruning requires manually designed, domain-specific abstract domains and semantics, and thus has only been used in domain-specific synthesizers.\n  This paper provides sufficient conditions under which a form of abstraction-based pruning can be automated for arbitrary synthesis problems in the general-purpose Semantics-Guided Synthesis (SemGuS) framework without requiring manually-defined abstract domains. We show that if the semantics of the language for which we are synthesizing programs exhibits some monotonicity properties, one can obtain an abstract interval-based semantics for free from the concrete semantics of the programming language, and use such semantics to effectively prune the search space. We also identify a condition that ensures such abstract semantics can be used to compute a precise abstraction of the set of values that a program derivable from a given hole in a partial program can produce. These precise abstractions make abstraction-based pruning more effective.\n  We implement our approach in a tool, Moito, which can tackle synthesis problems defined in the SemGuS framework. Moito can automate interval-based pruning without any a-priori knowledge of the problem domain, and solve synthesis problems that previously required domain-specific, abstraction-based synthesizers -- e.g., synthesis of regular expressions, CSV file schema, and imperative programs from examples.",

        "Abstract": "Semantics-Guided Synthesis (SemGuS) provides a framework to specify synthesis problems in a solver-agnostic and domain-agnostic way, by allowing a user to provide both the syntax and semantics of the language in which the desired program should be synthesized. Because synthesis and verification are closely intertwined, the SemGuS framework raises the problem of how to verify programs in a solver and domain-agnostic way.\n  We prove that the problem of verifying whether a program is a valid solution to a SemGuS problem can be reduced to proving validity of a query in the `CLP calculus, a fixed-point logic that generalizes Constrained Horn Clauses and co-Constrained Horn Clauses. Our encoding into `CLP allows us to further classify the SemGuS verification problems into ones that are reducible to validity of (i) first-order-logic formulas, (ii) Constrained Horn Clauses, (iii) co-Constrained Horn Clauses, and (iv) `CLP queries. Furthermore, our encoding shines light on some limitations of the SemGuS framework, such as its inability to model nondeterminism and reactive synthesis. We thus propose a modification to SemGuS that makes it more expressive, and for which verifying solutions is exactly equivalent to proving validity of a query in the `CLP calculus. Our implementation of SemGuS verifiers based on the above encoding can verify instances that were not even encodable in previous work. Furthermore, we use our SemGuS verifiers within an enumeration-based SemGuS solver to correctly synthesize solutions to SemGuS problems that no previous SemGuS synthesizer could solve.",

        "Abstract": "Program verification and synthesis frameworks that allow one to customize the language in which one is interested typically require the user to provide a formally defined semantics for the language. Because writing a formal semantics can be a daunting and error-prone task, this requirement stands in the way of such frameworks being adopted by non-expert users. We present an algorithm that can automatically synthesize inductively defined syntax-directed semantics when given (i) a grammar describing the syntax of a language and (ii) an executable (closed-box) interpreter for computing the semantics of programs in the language of the grammar. Our algorithm synthesizes the semantics in the form of Constrained-Horn Clauses (CHCs), a natural, extensible, and formal logical framework for specifying inductively defined relations that has recently received widespread adoption in program verification and synthesis. The key innovation of our synthesis algorithm is a Counterexample-Guided Synthesis (CEGIS) approach that breaks the hard problem of synthesizing a set of constrained Horn clauses into small, tractable expression-synthesis problems that can be dispatched to existing SyGuS synthesizers. Our tool Synantic synthesized inductively-defined formal semantics from 14 interpreters for languages used in program-synthesis applications. When synthesizing formal semantics for one of our benchmarks, Synantic unveiled an inconsistency in the semantics computed by the interpreter for a language of regular expressions; fixing the inconsistency resulted in a more efficient semantics and, for some cases, in a 1.2x speedup for a synthesizer solving synthesis problems over such a language.",

        "Abstract": "The development of software applications using multiple programming languages has increased in recent years, as it allows the selection of the most suitable language and runtime for each component of the system and the integration of third-party libraries. However, this practice involves complexity and error proneness, due to the absence of an adequate system for the interoperability of multiple programming languages. Developers are compelled to resort to workarounds, such as library reimplementation or language-specific wrappers, which are often dependent on C as the common denominator for interoperability. These challenges render the use of multiple programming languages a burdensome and demanding task that necessitates highly skilled developers for implementation, debugging, and maintenance, and raise doubts about the benefits of interoperability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MetaFFI, a pluggable in-process indirect-interoperability system that allows the loading and utilization of entities from multiple programming languages. This is achieved by exploiting the less restrictive shallow binding mechanisms (e.g., Foreign Function Interface) to offer deep binding features (e.g., object creation, methods, fields). MetaFFI provides a runtime-independent framework to load and \\emph{xcall} (Cross-Call) foreign entities (e.g., functions, objects). MetaFFI uses Common Data Types (CDTs) to pass parameters and return values, including objects and complex types, and even cross-language callbacks. The indirect interoperability approach of MetaFFI has the significant advantage of requiring only $2n$ mechanisms to support $n$ languages, as opposed to the direct interoperability approaches that need $n^2$ mechanisms. We have successfully tested the binding between Go, Python3.11, and Java in a proof-of-concept on Windows and Ubuntu.",

        "Abstract": "By combining Datalog, SMT solving, and functional programming, the language Formulog provides an appealing mix of features for implementing SMT-based static analyses (e.g., refinement type checking, symbolic execution) in a natural, declarative way. At the same time, the performance of its custom Datalog solver can be an impediment to using Formulog beyond prototyping -- a common problem for Datalog variants that aspire to solve large problem instances. In this work we speed up Formulog evaluation, with surprising results: while 2.2x speedups are obtained by using the conventional techniques for high-performance Datalog (e.g., compilation, specialized data structures), the big wins come by abandoning the central assumption in modern performant Datalog engines, semi-naive Datalog evaluation. In its place, we develop eager evaluation, a concurrent Datalog evaluation algorithm that explores the logical inference space via a depth-first traversal order. In practice, eager evaluation leads to an advantageous distribution of Formulog's SMT workload to external SMT solvers and improved SMT solving times: our eager evaluation extensions to the Formulog interpreter and Soufflé's code generator achieve mean 5.2x and 7.6x speedups, respectively, over the optimized code generated by off-the-shelf Soufflé on SMT-heavy Formulog benchmarks.\n  Using compilation and eager evaluation, Formulog implementations of refinement type checking, bottom-up pointer analysis, and symbolic execution achieve speedups on 20 out of 23 benchmarks over previously published, hand-tuned analyses written in F#, Java, and C++, providing strong evidence that Formulog can be the basis of a realistic platform for SMT-based static analysis. Moreover, our experience adds nuance to the conventional wisdom that semi-naive evaluation is the one-size-fits-all best Datalog evaluation algorithm for static analysis workloads.",

        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, StarCoder, and CodeLlama, are transforming the way developers approach programming by automatically generating code based on given natural language descriptions. Despite advancements, generating syntactically and semantically correct code remains challenging, especially for complex programming tasks. Existing approaches typically generate multiple candidate solutions using LLMs to increase the likelihood of producing correct code. However, selecting the correct code from these candidates-a process known as code ranking-remains a major challenge. Current research on code ranking can be categorized into execution-based and non-execution-based methods. Execution-based methods, although effective, encounter notable limitations, such as scarcity of quality unit tests and security risks. Non-execution-based methods like CodeRanker, which rely solely on classification labels to train a code ranker, struggle to capture subtle errors and provide detailed error insights. Recognizing the strengths and limitations of both approaches, we propose a new method. The key insight of our work is that an effective code ranker is expected to truly comprehend the underlying causes of erroneous code, as relying solely on classification labels is insufficient. Inspired by this, this paper puts forward RankEF, an innovative approach for code ranking that leverages execution feedback. RankEF employs multi-task learning to integrate code classification with execution feedback generation. This approach enables the model to understand the reasons behind incorrect code, distinguishing between correct and incorrect solutions without the need to execute the code during the ranking phase. Experiments on three code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RankEF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CodeRanker.",

Also, we leverage the neural architecture search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) using LLM to improve the performance.

        "Abstract": "Code benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) coding capabilities. However, there is an unignorable programming language bias in existing code benchmarks -- over 95% code generation benchmarks are dominated by Python, leaving the LLMs' capabilities in other programming languages such as Java and C/C++ unknown. Moreover, coding task bias is also crucial. Most benchmarks focus on code generation capability, while benchmarks for code reasoning (given input, reasoning output; and given output, reasoning input), an essential coding capability, are insufficient. Yet, constructing multi-lingual benchmarks can be expensive and labor-intensive, and codes in contest websites such as Leetcode suffer from data contamination during training. To fill this gap, we propose CRUXEVAL-X, a multi-lingual code reasoning benchmark that contains 19 programming languages. It comprises at least 600 subjects for each language, along with 19K content-consistent tests in total. In particular, the construction pipeline of CRUXEVAL-X works in a fully automated and test-guided manner, which iteratively generates and repairs based on execution feedback. Also, to cross language barriers (e.g., dynamic/static type systems in Python/C++), we formulated various transition rules between language pairs to facilitate translation. Our intensive evaluation of 24 representative LLMs reveals the correlation between language pairs. For example, TypeScript and JavaScript show a significant positive correlation, while Racket has less correlation with other languages. More interestingly, even a model trained solely on Python can achieve at most 34.4% Pass@1 in other languages, revealing the cross-language generalization of LLMs.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic C-to-Rust translation is a promising way to enhance the reliability of legacy system software. However, C2Rust, an industrially developed translator, generates Rust code with unsafe features, undermining the translation's objective. While researchers have proposed techniques to remove unsafe features in C2Rust-generated code, these efforts have targeted only a limited subset of unsafe features. One important unsafe feature remaining unaddressed is a union, a type consisting of multiple fields sharing the same memory storage. Programmers often place a union with a tag in a struct to record the last-written field, but they can still access wrong fields. In contrast, Rust's tagged unions combine tags and unions at the language level, ensuring correct value access. In this work, we propose techniques to replace unions with tagged unions during C-to-Rust translation. We develop a static analysis that facilitates such replacement by identifying tag fields and the corresponding tag values. The analysis involves a must-points-to analysis computing struct field values and a heuristic interpreting these results. To enhance efficiency, we adopt intraprocedural function-wise analysis, allowing selective analysis of functions. Our evaluation on 36 real-world C programs shows that the proposed approach is (1) precise, identifying 74 tag fields with no false positives and only five false negatives, (2) mostly correct, with 17 out of 23 programs passing tests post-transformation, and (3) efficient, capable of analyzing and transforming 141k LOC in 4,910 seconds.",

Traditional fault localization (FL) techniques rely on executing the program and using the code coverage matrix in tandem with test case results to calculate a suspiciousness score for each function or line. Recently, learning-based FL techniques have harnessed machine learning models to extract meaningful features from the code coverage matrix and improve FL performance. These techniques, however, require compilable source code, existing test cases, and specialized tools for generating the code coverage matrix for each programming language of interest.\n  In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a simple but effective sequence generation approach for fine-tuning large language models of code (LLMCs) for FL tasks. LLMCs have recently received much attention for various software engineering problems. In line with these, we leverage the innate understanding of code that LLMCs have acquired through pre-training on large code corpora. Specifically, we fine-tune representative encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-based 13 LLMCs for FL tasks. Unlike previous approaches, LLMCs can analyze code sequences even with syntactic errors, since they do not rely on compiled input. Still, they have a limitation on the length of the input data. Therefore, for a fair comparison with existing FL techniques, we extract methods with errors from the project-level benchmark, Defects4J, and analyze them at the line level. Experimental results show that LLMCs fine-tuned with our approach successfully pinpoint error positions in 50.6\\%, 64.2\\%, and 72.3\\% of 1,291 methods in Defects4J for Top-1/3/5 prediction, outperforming the best learning-based state-of-the-art technique by up to 1.35, 1.12, and 1.08 times, respectively. Our findings suggest promising research directions for FL and automated program repair tasks using LLMCs.",

Our original results show that Galápagos can produce program variants that are proven to be functionally equivalent, even when the variants are written in a different programming language. Our systematic diversity measurement indicate that functionally equivalent variants produced by Galápagos, are statically different after compilation, and present diverging internal behavior at runtime. We demonstrate that the variants produced by Galápagos can protect C code against real miscompilation bugs which affect the Clang compiler.

        "Abstract": "WebAssembly (Wasm), as a compact, fast, and isolation-guaranteed binary format, can be compiled from more than 40 high-level programming languages. However, vulnerabilities in Wasm binaries could lead to sensitive data leakage and even threaten their hosting environments. To identify them, symbolic execution is widely adopted due to its soundness and the ability to automatically generate exploitations. However, existing symbolic executors for Wasm binaries are typically platform-specific, which means that they cannot support all Wasm features. They may also require significant manual interventions to complete the analysis and suffer from efficiency issues as well. In this paper, we propose an efficient and fully-functional symbolic execution engine, named SeeWasm. Compared with existing tools, we demonstrate that SeeWasm supports full-featured Wasm binaries without further manual intervention, while accelerating the analysis by 2 to 6 times. SeeWasm has been adopted by existing works to identify more than 30 0-day vulnerabilities or security issues in well-known C, Go, and SGX applications after compiling them to Wasm binaries.",

        "Abstract": "Open-source software (OSS) has experienced a surge in popularity, attributed to its collaborative development model and cost-effective nature. However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities. Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and trace the code involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules. They then use syntactic-level code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions. These methods are hindered by imprecisions due to (1) the inclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of syntactic-level code clone detection. This paper presents Vercation, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++. Vercation combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. It then backtraces historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code. We propose semantic-level code clone detection to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling to identify the vulnerable versions between the patch commit and the vic. We curate a dataset linking 74 OSS vulnerabilities and 1013 versions to evaluate Vercation. On this dataset, our approach achieves the F1 score of 92.4%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, Vercation detected 134 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.",

        "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed an upsurge in automatic code generation, garnering significant attention for register transfer level (RTL) code generation. Despite the potential of RTL code generation with natural language, it remains error-prone and limited to relatively small modules because of the substantial semantic gap between natural language expressions and hardware design intent. In response to the limitations, we propose a methodology that reduces the semantic gaps by utilizing C/C++ for generating hardware designs via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools. Basically, we build a set of C-to-HLS optimization strategies catering to various code patterns, such as nested loops and local arrays. Then, we apply these strategies to sequential C/C++ code through in-context learning, which provides the LLMs with exemplary C/C++ to HLS prompts. With this approach, HLS designs can be generated effectively. Since LLMs still face problems in determining the optimized pragma parameters precisely, we have a design space exploration (DSE) tool integrated for pragma parameter tuning. Furthermore, we also employ profiling tools to pinpoint the performance bottlenecks within a program and selectively convert bottleneck components to HLS code for hardware acceleration. By combining the LLM-based profiling, C/C++ to HLS translation, and DSE, we have established HLSPilot, the first LLM-enabled high-level synthesis framework, which can fully automate the high-level application acceleration on hybrid CPU-FPGA architectures. According to our experiments on real-world application benchmarks, HLSPilot achieve comparable performance in general and can even outperform manually crafted counterparts, thereby underscoring the substantial promise of LLM-assisted hardware designs.",

Thus, the effectiveness of deep learning methods, including large language models (LLMs), in detecting software vulnerabilities beyond these languages is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and classifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) using different prompt and role strategies. Our experimental study targets six state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs (GPT-3.5- Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, CodeLLama-7B, CodeLLama- 13B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) and five programming languages: Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. We compiled a multi-language vulnerability dataset from different sources, to ensure representativeness. Our results showed that GPT-4o achieves the highest vulnerability detection and CWE classification scores using a few-shot setting. Aside from the quantitative results of our study, we developed a library called CODEGUARDIAN integrated with VSCode which enables developers to perform LLM-assisted real-time vulnerability analysis in real-world security scenarios. We have evaluated CODEGUARDIAN with a user study involving 22 developers from the industry. Our study showed that, by using CODEGUARDIAN, developers are more accurate and faster at detecting vulnerabilities.",

By leveraging Ubuntu packages to compile a dataset of 20 billion tokens, we further continue pre-train CodeLlama as a Virtual Compiler (ViC), capable of compiling any source code of any language to assembly code. This approach allows for virtual compilation across a wide range of programming languages without the need for a real compiler, preserving semantic equivalency and expanding the possibilities for assembly code dataset construction. Furthermore, we use ViC to construct a sufficiently large dataset for assembly code search.

An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, allowing changes in one to be automatically reflected in the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and the difficult task of malware detection.",

To tackle this issue, various types of indirect call analyzers have been proposed. However, they do not fully leverage the semantic information of the program, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes Semantic-Enhanced Analysis (SEA), a new approach to enhance the effectiveness of indirect call analysis. Our fundamental insight is that for common programming practices, indirect calls often exhibit semantic similarity with their invoked targets. This semantic alignment serves as a supportive mechanism for static analysis techniques in filtering out false targets. Notably, contemporary large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive code corpora, encompassing tasks such as code summarization, making them well-suited for semantic analysis. Specifically, SEA leverages LLMs to generate natural language summaries of both indirect calls and target functions from multiple perspectives. Through further analysis of these summaries, SEA can determine their suitability as caller-callee pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that SEA can significantly enhance existing static analysis methods by producing more precise target sets for indirect calls.",

        ],
        "Abstract": "The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x-5x$ during SMT solving.",

However, these tests have revealed that Verilog code production using LLMs at current state-of-the-art lack sufficient functional correctness to be practically viable, compared to automatic generation of programs in general-purpose programming languages such as C, C++, Python, etc. With this as the key insight, in this paper we assess the performance of a two-stage software pipeline for automated Verilog RTL generation: LLM based automatic generation of annotated C++ code suitable for high-level synthesis (HLS), followed by HLS to generate Verilog RTL. We have benchmarked the performance of our proposed scheme using the open-source VerilogEval dataset, for four different industry-scale LLMs, and the Vitis HLS tool.

Symbolic execution is a popular static analysis technique used both in program verification and in bug detection software. It works by interpreting the code, introducing a symbol for each value unknown at compile time (e.g. user-given inputs), and carrying out calculations symbolically. The analysis engine strives to explore multiple execution paths simultaneously, although checking all paths is an intractable problem, due to the vast number of possibilities.\n  We focus on an error finding framework called the Clang Static Analyzer, and the infrastructure built around it named CodeChecker. The emphasis is on achieving end-to-end scalability. This includes the run time and memory consumption of the analysis, bug presentation to the users, automatic false positive suppression, incremental analysis, pattern discovery in the results, and usage in continuous integration loops. We also outline future directions and open problems concerning these tools.\n  While a rich literature exists on program verification software, error finding tools normally need to settle for survey papers on individual techniques. In this paper, we not only discuss individual methods, but also how these decisions interact and reinforce each other, creating a system that is greater than the sum of its parts. Although the Clang Static Analyzer can only handle C-family languages, the techniques introduced in this paper are mostly language-independent and applicable to other similar static analysis tools.",

We present an implementation of the framework and evaluate it on large data sets collected within educational support systems. Even though the equivalence problem for context-free languages is undecidable in general, the framework is able to handle a large portion of these datasets. It introduces and combines techniques from several areas, such as an abstract grammar transformation language to identify equivalent grammars as well as sufficiently similar inequivalent grammars, theory-based comparison algorithms for a large class of context-free languages, and a graph-theory-inspired grammar canonization that allows to efficiently identify isomorphic grammars.",

        "Abstract": "Software bugs require developers to exert significant effort to identify and resolve them, often consuming about one-third of their time. Bug localization, the process of pinpointing the exact source code files that need modification, is crucial in reducing this effort. Existing bug localization tools, typically reliant on deep learning techniques, face limitations in cross-project applicability and effectiveness in multi-language environments. Recent advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) offer detailed representations for bug localization. However, they encounter challenges with limited context windows and mapping accuracy. To address these issues, we propose BLAZE, an approach that employs dynamic chunking and hard example learning. First, BLAZE dynamically segments source code to minimize continuity loss. Then, BLAZE fine-tunes a GPT-based model using challenging bug cases, in order to enhance cross-project and cross-language bug localization. To support the capability of BLAZE, we create the BEETLEBOX dataset, which comprises 26,321 bugs from 29 large and thriving open-source projects across five different programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Go, and JavaScript). Our evaluations of BLAZE on three benchmark datasets BEETLEBOX, SWE-Bench, and Ye et al. demonstrate substantial improvements compared to six state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, BLAZE achieves up to an increase of 120% in Top 1 accuracy, 144% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), and 100% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). An extensive ablation study confirms the contributions of our pipeline components to the overall performance enhancement.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-head-self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across natural language processing and vision tasks. However, their quadratic dependence on sequence lengths has bottlenecked inference speeds. To circumvent this bottleneck, researchers have proposed various sparse-MHSA models, where a subset of full attention is computed. Despite their promise, current sparse libraries and compilers do not support high-performance implementations for diverse sparse-MHSA patterns due to the underlying sparse formats they operate on. These formats, which are typically designed for high-performance & scientific computing applications, are either curated for extreme amounts of random sparsity (<1% non-zero values), or specific sparsity patterns. However, the sparsity patterns in sparse-MHSA are moderately sparse (10-50% non-zero values) and varied, resulting in existing sparse-formats trading off generality for performance.\n  We bridge this gap, achieving both generality and performance, by proposing a novel sparse format: affine-compressed-sparse-row (ACSR) and supporting code-generation scheme, SPLAT, that generates high-performance implementations for diverse sparse-MHSA patterns on GPUs. Core to our proposed format and code generation algorithm is the observation that common sparse-MHSA patterns have uniquely regular geometric properties. These properties, which can be analyzed just-in-time, expose novel optimizations and tiling strategies that SPLAT exploits to generate high-performance implementations for diverse patterns. To demonstrate SPLAT's efficacy, we use it to generate code for various sparse-MHSA models, achieving geomean speedups of 2.05x and 4.05x over hand-written kernels written in triton and TVM respectively on A100 GPUs. Moreover, its interfaces are intuitive and easy to use with existing implementations of MHSA in JAX.",

There are two popular lines of work to address automated vulnerability detection. On one hand, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is usually utilized to scan source code for security vulnerabilities, especially in industries. On the other hand, deep learning (DL)-based methods, especially since the introduction of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated their potential in software vulnerability detection. However, there is no comparative study between SAST tools and LLMs, aiming to determine their effectiveness in vulnerability detection, understand the pros and cons of both SAST and LLMs, and explore the potential combination of these two families of approaches.\n  In this paper, we compared 15 diverse SAST tools with 12 popular or state-of-the-art open-source LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities from repositories of three popular programming languages: Java, C, and Python. The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\\% to 100\\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives. By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent. Our analysis sheds light on both the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.",

Alternatively, language models trained on a large dataset including many programs can consume program text, to act as a neural surrogate. Using a language model to both generate a surrogate and act as a surrogate, however, leading to a trade-off between resource consumption and accuracy. We present $\\textit{neural surrogate compilation}$, a technique for producing neural surrogates directly from program text without coupling neural surrogate generation and execution. We implement neural surrogate compilers using hypernetworks trained on a dataset of C programs and find that they produce neural surrogates that are $1.9$-$9.5\\times$ as data-efficient, produce visual results that are $1.0$-$1.3\\times$ more similar to ground truth, and train in $4.3$-$7.3\\times$ fewer epochs than neural surrogates trained from scratch.",

To this end, our work conducts a preliminary evaluation exploring the beliefs and behaviors of LLM used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five LLM-based programming assistants. Our findings show that LLM-based programming assistants have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims, lack credible evidence to support responses, and are incapable of adopting practices demonstrated by empirical SE research to support development tasks.

We estimate a country's software economic complexity and show that it complements the ability of measures of complexity based on trade, patents, and research papers to account for international differences in GDP per capita, income inequality, and emissions. We also show that open-source software follows the principle of relatedness, meaning that a country's software entries and exits are explained by specialization in related programming languages.

Nonetheless, customizing accelerators to diverse graph processing algorithms with distinct computational patterns remains challenging and error-prone for high-level application users. To this end, template-based approaches have been developed to automate the graph processing accelerator generation. Although these frameworks significantly enhance the design productivity, the templates often result in closely coupled algorithms, programming models, and architectures, severely limiting the versatility of the targeted graph processing algorithms and their applicability to high-level users. Furthermore, the limitations of the frameworks are usually ambiguous due to the absence of a rigorous grammar definition. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Graphitron, a domain-specific language (DSL), which allows users to generate customized accelerators for a wide range of graph processing algorithms on FPGAs without engaging with the complexities of low-level FPGA designs. Graphitron, by defining vertices and edges as primitive data types, naturally facilitates the description of graph algorithms using edge-centric or vertex-centric programming models. The Graphitron back-end employs a suite of hardware optimization techniques including pipelining, data shuffling, and memory access optimization that are independent with the specific algorithms, supporting the creation of versatile graph processing accelerators. Our experiments indicate that accelerators crafted using Graphitron achieve comparable performance to that generated with template-based design framework. Moreover, it exhibits exceptional flexibility in algorithm expression and significantly enhance accelerator design productivity.",

Although this technology was born to create portable and performant modules in web browsers, currently, its capabilities are extensively exploited in multiple and heterogeneous use-case scenarios. With the extensive effort of the community, new toolkits make the use of this technology more suitable for real-world applications. In this context, it is crucial to study the liaisons between the WebAssembly ecosystem and software security. Indeed, WebAssembly can be a medium for improving the security of a system, but it can also be exploited to evade detection systems or for performing cryptomining activities. In addition, programs developed in low-level languages such as C can be compiled in WebAssembly binaries, and it is interesting to evaluate the security impacts of executing programs vulnerable to attacks against memory in the WebAssembly sandboxed environment. Also, WebAssembly has been designed to provide a secure and isolated environment, but such capabilities should be assessed in order to analyze their weaknesses and propose new mechanisms for addressing them. Although some research works have provided surveys of the most relevant solutions aimed at discovering WebAssembly vulnerabilities or detecting attacks, at the time of writing, there is no comprehensive review of security-related literature in the WebAssembly ecosystem. We aim to fill this gap by proposing a comprehensive review of research works dealing with security in WebAssembly. We analyze 121 papers by identifying seven different security categories.\n  We hope that our work will provide insights into the complex landscape of WebAssembly and guide researchers, developers, and security professionals towards novel avenues in the realm of the WebAssembly ecosystem.",

Unfortunately, existing systems lack high-level abstractions to perform semantic queries at scale. We introduce semantic operators, a declarative programming interface that extends the relational model with composable AI-based operations for semantic queries over datasets (e.g., sorting or aggregating records using natural language criteria). Each operator can be implemented and optimized in multiple ways, opening a rich space for execution plans similar to relational operators. We implement our operators and several optimizations for them in LOTUS, an open-source query engine with a Pandas-like API.\n  We demonstrate LOTUS' effectiveness across a series of real applications, including fact-checking, extreme multi-label classification, and search. We find that LOTUS' programming model is highly expressive, capturing state-of-the-art query pipelines with low development overhead. Specifically, on the FEVER dataset, LOTUS' programs can reproduce FacTool, a recent state-of-the-art fact-checking pipeline, in few lines of code, and implement a new pipeline that improves accuracy by $9.5\\%$, while offering $7-34\\times$ lower execution time. In the extreme multi-label classification task on the BioDEX dataset, LOTUS reproduces state-of-the art result quality with its join operator, while providing an efficient algorithm that runs $800\\times$ faster than a naive join. In the search and ranking application, LOTUS allows a simple composition of operators to achieve $5.9 - 49.4\\%$ higher nDCG@10 than the vanilla retriever and re-ranker, while also providing query efficiency, with $1.67 - 10\\times$ lower execution time than LM-based ranking methods used by prior works.

Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in automatically generating code for general-purpose programming languages like Python. However, these methods fail on hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog due to the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning data, as even advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5 exhibit limited performance on Verilog generation. Regarding this issue, we observe that (1) Verilog code collected from the real world has higher quality than those generated by LLMs. (2) LLMs like GPT-3.5 excel in summarizing Verilog code rather than generating it. Based on these observations, this paper introduces CodeV, a series of open-source instruction-tuned Verilog generation LLMs. Instead of generating descriptions first and then getting the corresponding code from advanced LLMs, we prompt the LLM with Verilog code and let the LLM generate the corresponding natural language description by multi-level summarization. Experimental results show that CodeV relatively surpasses the previous open-source SOTA by 14.4% (BetterV in VerilogEval) and 11.3% (RTLCoder in RTLLM) respectively, and also relatively outperforms previous commercial SOTA GPT-4 by 22.1% in VerilogEval.",

We achieve this by defining name accessibility as a predicate on resolution paths through scope graphs. Since scope graphs are a language-independent model of name resolution, our model provides a uniform approach to defining different accessibility policies for different languages.\n  Our model is implemented in Statix, a logic language for executable type system specification using scope graphs.

Despite its expressivity, SSL suffers from two shortcomings that hinder its utility. First, its main specification component, inductive predicates, only admits first-order definitions of data structure shapes, which leads to the proliferation of ''boiler-plate'' predicates for specifying common patterns. Second, SSL requires concrete definitions of data structures to synthesise programs that manipulate them, which results in the need to change a specification for a synthesis task every time changes are introduced into the layout of the involved structures.\n  We propose to significantly lift the level of abstraction used in writing Separation Logic specifications for synthesis -- both simplifying the approach and making the specifications more usable and easy to read and follow. We avoid the need to repetitively re-state low-level representation details throughout the specifications -- allowing the reuse of different implementations of the same data structure by abstracting away the details of a specific layout used in memory. Our novel high-level front-end language called Pika significantly improves the expressiveness of SuSLik.\n  We implemented a layout-agnostic synthesiser from Pika to SuSLik enabling push-button synthesis of C programs with in-place memory updates, along with the accompanying full proofs that they meet Separation Logic-style specifications, from high-level specifications that resemble ordinary functional programs. Our experiments show that our tool can produce C code that is comparable in its performance characteristics and is sometimes faster than Haskell.",

        "Abstract": "To support software developers in understanding and maintaining programs, various automatic (source) code summarization techniques have been proposed to generate a concise natural language summary (i.e., comment) for a given code snippet. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to a great boost in the performance of code-related tasks. In this paper, we undertake a systematic and comprehensive study on code summarization in the era of LLMs, which covers multiple aspects involved in the workflow of LLM-based code summarization. Specifically, we begin by examining prevalent automated evaluation methods for assessing the quality of summaries generated by LLMs and find that the results of the GPT-4 evaluation method are most closely aligned with human evaluation. Then, we explore the effectiveness of five prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, critique, and expert) in adapting LLMs to code summarization tasks. Contrary to expectations, advanced prompting techniques may not outperform simple zero-shot prompting. Next, we investigate the impact of LLMs' model settings (including top\\_p and temperature parameters) on the quality of generated summaries. We find the impact of the two parameters on summary quality varies by the base LLM and programming language, but their impacts are similar. Moreover, we canvass LLMs' abilities to summarize code snippets in distinct types of programming languages. The results reveal that LLMs perform suboptimally when summarizing code written in logic programming languages compared to other language types. Finally, we unexpectedly find that CodeLlama-Instruct with 7B parameters can outperform advanced GPT-4 in generating summaries describing code implementation details and asserting code properties. We hope that our findings can provide a comprehensive understanding of code summarization in the era of LLMs.",

        "Abstract": "Optimization problems seek to find the best solution to an objective under a set of constraints, and have been widely investigated in real-world applications. Modeling and solving optimization problems in a specific domain typically require a combination of domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, making it difficult for general users and even domain professionals. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called OptLLM that augments LLMs with external solvers. Specifically, OptLLM accepts user queries in natural language, convert them into mathematical formulations and programming codes, and calls the solvers to calculate the results for decision-making. In addition, OptLLM supports multi-round dialogues to gradually refine the modeling and solving of optimization problems. To illustrate the effectiveness of OptLLM, we provide tutorials on three typical optimization applications and conduct experiments on both prompt-based GPT models and a fine-tuned Qwen model using a large-scale selfdeveloped optimization dataset. Experimental results show that OptLLM works with various LLMs, and the fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy boost compared to the promptbased models. Some features of OptLLM framework have been available for trial since June 2023 (https://opt.alibabacloud.com/chat or https://opt.aliyun.com/chat).",

        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions. However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software. Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs. Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs. METHOD: First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation. For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. RESULTS: Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.",

        "Abstract": "When attempting to understand the behavior of an executable, a binary analyst can make use of many different techniques. These include program slicing, dynamic instrumentation, binary-level rewriting, symbolic execution, and formal verification, all of which can uncover insights into how a piece of machine code behaves. As a result, there is no one-size-fits-all binary analysis tool, so a binary analysis researcher will often combine several different tools. Sometimes, a researcher will even need to design new tools to study problems that existing frameworks are not well equipped to handle. Designing such tools from complete scratch is rarely time- or cost-effective, however, given the scale and complexity of modern instruction set architectures.\n  We present Macaw, a modular framework that makes it possible to rapidly build reliable binary analysis tools across a range of use cases. Over a decade of development, we have used Macaw to support an industrial research team in building tools for machine code-related tasks. As such, the name \"Macaw\" refers not just to the framework itself, but also a suite of tools that are built on top of the framework. We describe Macaw in depth and describe the different static and dynamic analyses that it performs, many of which are powered by an SMT-based symbolic execution engine. We put a particular focus on interoperability between machine code and higher-level languages, including binary lifting from x86 to LLVM, as well verifying the correctness of mixed C and assembly code.",

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in coding and testing. We explored the capabilities of Davinci (text-davinci-002) and ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) in creating unit tests for C++ parallel programs. Our results show that LLMs can generate mostly correct and comprehensive unit tests, although they have some limitations, such as repetitive assertions and blank test cases.",

Within the computing education research (CER) domain, LLMs have received plenty of attention especially in the context of learning programming. Much of the work on LLMs in CER has however focused on applying and evaluating proprietary models. In this article, we evaluate the efficiency of open-source LLMs in generating high-quality feedback for programming assignments, and in judging the quality of the programming feedback, contrasting the results against proprietary models. Our evaluations on a dataset of students' submissions to Python introductory programming exercises suggest that the state-of-the-art open-source LLMs (Meta's Llama3) are almost on-par with proprietary models (GPT-4o) in both the generation and assessment of programming feedback. We further demonstrate the efficiency of smaller LLMs in the tasks, and highlight that there are a wide range of LLMs that are accessible even for free for educators and practitioners.",

Although they have shown strong performance on traditional language understanding tasks, large language models struggle to solve compositional tasks, where the solution depends on solving smaller instances of the same problem. We propose a natural approach to solve compositional tasks recursively. Our method, Re-Tuning, tunes models to break down a problem into subproblems, solve those subproblems, and combine the results. We show that our method significantly improves model performance on three representative compositional tasks: integer addition, dynamic programming, and parity. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that keep intermediate steps towards solving the problems, Re-Tuning achieves significantly higher accuracy and is more GPU memory efficient.",

The widespread use of these languages makes the risk of memory-related attacks very high. There are well-known detection mechanisms, but they do not address software resilience. An earlier approach proposes the Secure Domain Rewind and Discard (SDRaD) of isolated domains as a method to enhance the resilience of software targeted by runtime attacks on x86 architecture, based on hardware-enforced Memory Protection Key (MPK). In this work, SDRaD has been adapted to work with the Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) architecture to be more lightweight and performant. The results obtained in this thesis show that CHERI-SDRaD, the prototype adaption that leverages the memory-safety properties inherent to the CHERI architecture, results in a solution with less performance degradation (2.2% in Nginx benchmarks) compared to earlier results obtained with the original SDRaD prototype on an Intel-based architecture. The adaption to CHERI additionally allowed limitations inherent to the MPK-based approach to be resolved.",

        "Abstract": "In High-Level Synthesis (HLS), converting a regular C/C++ program into its HLS-compatible counterpart (HLS-C) still requires tremendous manual effort. Various program scripts have been introduced to automate this process. But the resulting codes usually contain many issues that should be manually repaired by developers. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automate code generation, they can also be used for automated program repair in HLS. However, due to the limited training of LLMs considering hardware and software simultaneously, hallucinations may occur during program repair using LLMs, leading to compilation failures. Besides, using LLMs for iterative repair also incurs a high cost. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-driven program repair framework that takes regular C/C++ code as input and automatically generates its corresponding HLS-C code for synthesis while minimizing human repair effort. To mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs and enhance the prompt quality, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm is introduced to guide the LLMs toward correct repair. In addition, we use LLMs to create a static bit width optimization program to identify the optimized bit widths for variables. Moreover, LLM-driven HLS optimization strategies are introduced to add/tune pragmas in HLS-C programs for circuit optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-driven automated framework can achieve much higher repair pass rates in 24 real-world applications compared with the traditional scripts and the direct application of LLMs for program repair.",

        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have an unrivaled and invaluable ability to \"align\" their output to a diverse range of human preferences, by mirroring them in the text they generate. The internal characteristics of such models, however, remain largely opaque. This work presents the Injectable Realignment Model (IRM) as a novel approach to language model interpretability and explainability. Inspired by earlier work on Neural Programming Interfaces, we construct and train a small network -- the IRM -- to induce emotion-based alignments within a 7B parameter LLM architecture. The IRM outputs are injected via layerwise addition at various points during the LLM's forward pass, thus modulating its behavior without changing the weights of the original model. This isolates the alignment behavior from the complex mechanisms of the transformer model. Analysis of the trained IRM's outputs reveals a curious pattern. Across more than 24 training runs and multiple alignment datasets, patterns of IRM activations align themselves in striations associated with a neuron's index within each transformer layer, rather than being associated with the layers themselves. Further, a single neuron index (1512) is strongly correlated with all tested alignments. This result, although initially counterintuitive, is directly attributable to design choices present within almost all commercially available transformer architectures, and highlights a potential weak point in Meta's pretrained Llama 2 models. It also demonstrates the value of the IRM architecture for language model analysis and interpretability.

However, their application in the domain of code and compiler optimization remains underexplored. Training LLMs is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU hours and extensive data collection, which can be prohibitive. To address this gap, we introduce Meta Large Language Model Compiler (LLM Compiler), a suite of robust, openly available, pre-trained models specifically designed for code optimization tasks. Built on the foundation of Code Llama, LLM Compiler enhances the understanding of compiler intermediate representations (IRs), assembly language, and optimization techniques. The model has been trained on a vast corpus of 546 billion tokens of LLVM-IR and assembly code and has undergone instruction fine-tuning to interpret compiler behavior. LLM Compiler is released under a bespoke commercial license to allow wide reuse and is available in two sizes: 7 billion and 13 billion parameters. We also present fine-tuned versions of the model, demonstrating its enhanced capabilities in optimizing code size and disassembling from x86_64 and ARM assembly back into LLVM-IR. These achieve 77% of the optimising potential of an autotuning search, and 45% disassembly round trip (14% exact match). This release aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective foundation for further research and development in compiler optimization by both academic researchers and industry practitioners.",

However, in many practical scenarios, it becomes increasingly challenging for these models to navigate the intricate boundary between helpfulness and safety, especially against highly complex yet potentially malicious instructions. In this work, we introduce INDICT: a new framework that empowers LLMs with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for both safety and helpfulness guidance. The internal dialogue is a dual cooperative system between a safety-driven critic and a helpfulness-driven critic. Each critic provides analysis against the given task and corresponding generated response, equipped with external knowledge queried through relevant code snippets and tools like web search and code interpreter. We engage the dual critic system in both code generation stage as well as code execution stage, providing preemptive and post-hoc guidance respectively to LLMs. We evaluated INDICT on 8 diverse tasks across 8 programming languages from 5 benchmarks, using LLMs from 7B to 70B parameters. We observed that our approach can provide an advanced level of critiques of both safety and helpfulness analysis, significantly improving the quality of output codes ($+10\\%$ absolute improvements in all models).",

Results show that GLMs can be fine-tuned to achieve adequate, though not state-of-the-art, performance. In addition to ATS, we take small steps towards analyzing models' capacity for generating feedback by prompting GLMs to explain their scores.

SCIF supports a rich ecosystem of interacting principals with partial trust through its mechanisms for dynamic trust management. SCIF has been implemented as a compiler to Solidity.

        "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become an increasingly important workload for cloud providers catering to both enterprise and consumer applications. LLM inference requests from these applications have end-to-end latency SLOs that must be adhered to in production settings. However, existing LLM serving systems focus on optimization objectives such as request serving throughput or request execution latency rather than the end-to-end latency SLOs. Achieving end-to-end SLOs for latency-sensitive requests is challenging due to head-of-line (HOL) blocking in the request queue, which results from bursty arrival rates and insufficient resources.\n  To address the above challenge, we propose QLM, a multi-model queue management framework for LLM serving. QLM uses stochastic programming to orchestrate the actions of multiple LLM Serving Operations (LSOs) to reduce HOL blocking and maximize SLO attainment. Specifically, QLM uses the following LSOs: model swapping, request eviction, GPU-CPU state swapping, load balancing, and warm model start. Evaluation on heterogeneous GPU devices and models with real-world LLM serving dataset shows that QLM improves SLO attainment by 40-90% and throughput by 20-400% while maintaining or improving device utilization compared to other state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.",

Our system integrates large language models (LLMs), enabling non-experts to articulate task requirements to the system through a chat interface. Key features of the framework include: integration of ROS with an AI agent connected to a plethora of open-source and commercial LLMs, automatic extraction of a behavior from the LLM output and execution of ROS actions/services, support for three behavior modes (sequence, behavior tree, state machine), imitation learning for adding new robot actions to the library of possible actions, and LLM reflection via human and environment feedback. Extensive experiments validate the framework, showcasing robustness, scalability, and versatility in diverse scenarios, including long-horizon tasks, tabletop rearrangements, and remote supervisory control.

        "Abstract": "Multiscale models provide a unique tool for studying complex processes that study events occurring at different scales across space and time. In the context of biological systems, such models can simulate mechanisms happening at the intracellular level such as signaling, and at the extracellular level where cells communicate and coordinate with other cells. They aim to understand the impact of genetic or environmental deregulation observed in complex diseases, describe the interplay between a pathological tissue and the immune system, and suggest strategies to revert the diseased phenotypes. The construction of these multiscale models remains a very complex task, including the choice of the components to consider, the level of details of the processes to simulate, or the fitting of the parameters to the data. One additional difficulty is the expert knowledge needed to program these models in languages such as C++ or Python, which may discourage the participation of non-experts. Simplifying this process through structured description formalisms -- coupled with a graphical interface -- is crucial in making modeling more accessible to the broader scientific community, as well as streamlining the process for advanced users. This article introduces three examples of multiscale models which rely on the framework PhysiBoSS, an add-on of PhysiCell that includes intracellular descriptions as continuous time Boolean models to the agent-based approach. The article demonstrates how to easily construct such models, relying on PhysiCell Studio, the PhysiCell Graphical User Interface. A step-by-step tutorial is provided as a Supplementary Material and all models are provided at: https://physiboss.github.io/tutorial/.",

This study evaluates the efficiency gains, areas for improvement, and emerging challenges of using GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant. We identified 15 software development tasks and assessed Copilot's benefits through real-world projects on large proprietary code bases. Our findings indicate significant reductions in developer toil, with up to 50% time saved in code documentation and autocompletion, and 30-40% in repetitive coding tasks, unit test generation, debugging, and pair programming. However, Copilot struggles with complex tasks, large functions, multiple files, and proprietary contexts, particularly with C/C++ code. We project a 33-36% time reduction for coding-related tasks in a cloud-first software development lifecycle. This study aims to quantify productivity improvements, identify underperforming scenarios, examine practical benefits and challenges, investigate performance variations across programming languages, and discuss emerging issues related to code quality, security, and developer experience.",

We demonstrate how the addition of symbolic analysis to the workflow impacts the quality of annotations: information about input/output examples from Pathcrawler produce more context-aware annotations, while the inclusion of EVA reports yields annotations more attuned to runtime errors. In addition, we show that the method infers rather the programs intent than its behaviour, by generating specifications for buggy programs and observing robustness of the result against bugs.",

Indeed, recent research has shown that LLMs are capable of solving the majority of the assignments and exams we previously used in CS1. In addition, professional software engineers are often using these tools, raising the question of whether we should be training our students in their use as well. This experience report describes a CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that fully embraces the use of LLMs from the beginning of the course. To incorporate the LLMs, the course was intentionally altered to reduce emphasis on syntax and writing code from scratch. Instead, the course now emphasizes skills needed to successfully produce software with an LLM. This includes explaining code, testing code, and decomposing large problems into small functions that are solvable by an LLM. In addition to frequent, formative assessments of these skills, students were given three large, open-ended projects in three separate domains (data science, image processing, and game design) that allowed them to showcase their creativity in topics of their choosing. In an end-of-term survey, students reported that they appreciated learning with the assistance of the LLM and that they interacted with the LLM in a variety of ways when writing code. We provide lessons learned for instructors who may wish to incorporate LLMs into their course.",

Many in-situ observations have shown that the plant cover plays a key roll in controlling the hydrological flux at a catchment scale. The plant roots facilitate the infiltration processes, the canopy intercept some proportion of rain, and plant stems slow down the flow. In case of heavy rains, the infiltration and interception processes cease in a short time, the remaining rainfall gives rise to the Hortonian overland flow and the flash flood is thus initiated. In this context, the following problem is also addressed in the article: how do the gradient of soil surface and the density of the plant cover influence the water dynamics in the Hortonian flow? The mathematical model and ASTERIX were kept as simple as possible in order to be accessible to a wide range of stakeholders interested in understanding the complex processes behind the water flow on hillslopes covered by plants.\n  The software is written in C programming language and it is free under GNU license. It was tested on a series of benchmark problems, laboratory experiments, and theoretical problems; and the results have shown a good agreement with the theoretical or measured data.",

        "Abstract": "Program repair techniques offer cost-saving benefits for debugging within software development and programming education scenarios. With the proven effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-related tasks, researchers have explored their potential for program repair. However, it is crucial to recognize that existing repair benchmarks may have influenced LLM training data, potentially causing data leakage. To evaluate LLMs' realistic repair capabilities, (1) we introduce an extensive, non-crawled benchmark, referred to as TutorCode, comprising 1,239 C++ defect codes and associated information such as tutor guidance, solution description, failing test cases, and the corrected code. Our work assesses the repair performance of 12 LLMs on TutorCode, measuring repair correctness (TOP-5 and AVG-5) and patch precision (RPSR). (2) We then provide a comprehensive investigation into which types of extra information can help LLMs improve their performance in repairing defects. Among these types, tutor guidance was found to be the most effective information in enhancing LLM repair capabilities. To fully harness LLMs' conversational capabilities and the benefits of augmented information, (3) we introduce a novel conversational semi-automatic repair framework CREF assisting human tutor. It demonstrates a remarkable AVG-5 improvement of 17.2%-24.6% compared to the baseline, achieving an impressive AVG-5 of 76.6% when utilizing GPT-4. These results highlight the potential for enhancing LLMs' repair capabilities through interactions with tutors and historical conversations involving incorrect responses. The successful application of CREF in a real-world educational setting demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing tutors' workload and improving students' learning experience, while also showcasing its promise for facilitating other software engineering tasks, such as code review.",

We derive exact analytic and computationally efficient expressions for the log-likelihood function and the posterior distributions in the case where the observations are sampled on either a completely or partially regular grid. This enables us to fit the model to large data sets that are currently computationally inaccessible using a standard implementation.

APPL provides an intuitive and Python-native syntax, an efficient parallelized runtime with asynchronous semantics, and a tracing module supporting effective failure diagnosis and replaying without extra costs. We demonstrate that APPL programs are intuitive, concise, and efficient through three representative scenarios: Chain-of-Thought with self-consistency (CoT-SC), ReAct tool use agent, and multi-agent chat. Experiments on three parallelizable workflows further show that APPL can effectively parallelize independent LLM calls, with a significant speedup ratio that almost matches the estimation.",

        "Abstract": "Code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate LLMs' capabilities. However, after consolidating the latest 24 benchmarks, we noticed three significant imbalances. First, imbalanced programming language. 95.8% of benchmarks involve Python, while only 5 benchmarks involve Java. Second, imbalanced code granularity. Function-/statement-level benchmarks account for over 83.3% of benchmarks. Only a mere handful extends to class-/project-levels, and all are limited to Python. Third, lacking advanced features. Existing benchmarks primarily assess basic coding skills, while overlooking advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features (i.e., encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).\n  To fill these gaps, we propose JavaBench, a project-level Java benchmark that exercises OOP features. It comprises four Java projects with 389 methods in 106 Java classes. The test coverage is up to 92%, and JavaBench is attested by 282 undergraduate students, reaching a 90.93/100 average score (i.e., pass rate against the test suite), ensuring the quality of documentation, code skeleton, and tests. To better evaluate LLM's capability against JavaBench, we introduce a systematic evaluation design covering three context settings and five synthesis strategies at two granularities using three hierarchical metrics. Our extensive experiment yields several interesting findings. First, we noticed that regarding project-level Java programming, LLMs are far behind undergraduate students (no project can be correctly completed by any studied LLMs, and at most 41.17% Pass@5 in a more relaxed evaluation). Second, using method signature as prompt context may strike an ideal balance for project-level code generation. JavaBench is publicly available at https://github.com/java-bench/JavaBench.",

They do this by observing pairs of words in the reconstructed language (protoforms) and the descendent language (reflexes) and constructing a program that transforms protoforms into reflexes. However, writing these programs is error-prone and time-consuming. Prior work has successfully scaffolded this process computationally, but fewer researchers have tackled Sound Law Induction (SLI), which we approach in this paper by casting it as Programming by Examples. We propose a language-agnostic solution that utilizes the programming ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating Python sound law programs from sound change examples. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach for various LLMs, propose effective methods to generate additional language-agnostic synthetic data to fine-tune LLMs for SLI, and compare our method with existing automated SLI methods showing that while LLMs lag behind them they can complement some of their weaknesses.",

This paper takes a step towards leveraging PP for reasoning about data-aware processes. To this end, we present a systematic translation of Data Petri Nets (DPNs) into a model written in a PP language whose features are supported by most PP systems. We show that our translation is sound and provides statistical guarantees for simulating DPNs. Furthermore, we discuss how PP can be used for process mining tasks and report on a prototype implementation of our translation. We also discuss further analysis scenarios that could be easily approached based on the proposed translation and available PP tools.",

However, it is unclear how well these models perform on tasks that require a combination of these skills. In this paper, we curate a novel program synthesis benchmark based on the XLogoOnline visual programming environment. The benchmark comprises 85 real-world tasks from the Mini-level of the XLogoOnline environment, each requiring a combination of different skills such as spatial planning, basic programming, and logical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Llama3-70B struggle to solve these tasks, achieving only 20% and 2.35% success rates. Next, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline to boost the performance of models by leveraging a large-scale synthetic training dataset with over 80000 tasks. Moreover, we showcase how emulator-driven feedback can be used to design a curriculum over training data distribution. We showcase that a fine-tuned Llama3-8B drastically outperforms GPT-4V and Llama3-70B models, and provide an in-depth analysis of the models' expertise across different skill dimensions. We will publicly release the benchmark for future research on program synthesis in visual programming.",

In addition to that, we evaluate code's time and memory efficiency and compare it to the average human results. In total, we generate solutions for 1760 problems for each programming language and evaluate all the Copilot's suggestions for each problem, resulting in over 50000 submissions to LeetCode spread over a 2-month period. We found that Copilot successfully solved most of the problems. However, Copilot was rather more successful in generating code in Java and C++ than in Python3 and Rust. Moreover, in case of Python3 Copilot proved to be rather unreliable in the code generation phase. We also discovered that Copilot's top-ranked suggestions are not always the best. In addition, we analysed how the topic of the problem impacts the correctness rate. Finally, based on statistics information from LeetCode, we can conclude that Copilot generates more efficient code than an average human.",

This paper introduces a novel dataset, Tropes in Movies (TiM), designed as a testbed for exploring two critical yet previously overlooked video reasoning skills: (1) Abstract Perception: understanding and tokenizing abstract concepts in videos, and (2) Long-range Compositional Reasoning: planning and integrating intermediate reasoning steps for understanding long-range videos with numerous frames. Utilizing tropes from movie storytelling, TiM evaluates the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches. Our experiments show that current methods, including Captioner-Reasoner, Large Multimodal Model Instruction Fine-tuning, and Visual Programming, only marginally outperform a random baseline when tackling the challenges of Abstract Perception and Long-range Compositional Reasoning. To address these deficiencies, we propose Face-Enhanced Viper of Role Interactions (FEVoRI) and Context Query Reduction (ConQueR), which enhance Visual Programming by fostering role interaction awareness and progressively refining movie contexts and trope queries during reasoning processes, significantly improving performance by 15 F1 points. However, this performance still lags behind human levels (40 vs. 65 F1). Additionally, we introduce a new protocol to evaluate the necessity of Abstract Perception and Long-range Compositional Reasoning for task resolution. This is done by analyzing the code generated through Visual Programming using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), thereby confirming the increased complexity of TiM.

Code style transfer, however, is difficult to automate except for trivial style guidelines such as limits on line length. Inspired by the success of using language models for text style transfer, we investigate if code language models can perform code style transfer. Code style transfer, unlike text transfer, has rigorous requirements: the system needs to identify lines of code to change, change them correctly, and leave the rest of the program untouched. We designed CSB (Code Style Benchmark), a benchmark suite of code style transfer tasks across five categories including converting for-loops to list comprehensions, eliminating duplication in code, adding decorators to methods, etc. We then used these tests to see if large pre-trained code language models or fine-tuned models perform style transfer correctly, based on rigorous metrics to test that the transfer did occur, and the code still passes functional tests. Surprisingly, language models failed to perform all of the tasks, suggesting that they perform poorly on tasks that require code understanding. We will make available the large-scale corpora to help the community build better code models.",

        "Abstract": "Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is a methodology that assembles pre-existing, re-usable software components into new applications, which is particularly relevant for fast moving, data-intensive fields such as bioinformatics. While Perl was used extensively in this field until a decade ago, more recent applications opt for a Bioconductor/R or Python. This trend represents a significantly missed opportunity for the rapid generation of novel bioinformatic applications out of pre-existing components since Perl offers a variety of abstractions that can facilitate composition. In this paper, we illustrate the utility of Perl for CBSE through a combination of Object Oriented frameworks, the Perl Data Language and facilities for interfacing with non-Perl code through Foreign Function Interfaces and inlining of foreign source code. To do so, we enhance Polyester, a RNA sequencing simulator written in R, and edlib a fast sequence similarity search library based on the edit distance. The first case study illustrates the near effortless authoring of new, highly performant Perl modules for the simulation of random numbers using the GNU Scientific Library and PDL, and proposes Perl and Perl/C alternatives to the Python tool cutadapt that is used to \"trim\" polyA tails from biological sequences. For the edlib case, we leverage the power of metaclass programming to endow edlib with coarse, process based parallelism, through the Many Core Engine (MCE) module and fine grained parallelism through OpenMP, a C/C++/Fortran Application Programming Interface for shared memory multithreaded processing. These use cases provide proof-of-concept for the Bio::SeqAlignment framework, which can organize heterogeneous components in complex memory and command-line based workflows for the construction of novel bionformatic tools to analyze data from long-read sequencing, e.g. Nanopore, sequencing platforms.",

However, in LLM-based code completion, LLMs may struggle to use correct and up-to-date Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) due to the rapid and continuous evolution of libraries. While existing studies have highlighted issues with predicting incorrect APIs, the specific problem of deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion has not been thoroughly investigated.\n  To address this gap, we conducted the first evaluation study on deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion. This study involved seven advanced LLMs, 145 API mappings from eight popular Python libraries, and 28,125 completion prompts. The study results reveal the \\textit{status quo} and \\textit{root causes} of deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion from the perspectives of \\textit{model}, \\textit{prompt}, and \\textit{library}. Based on these findings, we propose two lightweight fixing approaches, \\textsc{ReplaceAPI} and \\textsc{InsertPrompt}, which can serve as baseline approaches for future research on mitigating deprecated API usage in LLM-based completion. Additionally, we provide implications for future research on integrating library evolution with LLM-driven software development.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, domain-specific accelerators (DSAs) have gained popularity for applications such as deep learning and autonomous driving. To facilitate DSA designs, programmers use high-level synthesis (HLS) to compile a high-level description written in C/C++ into a design with low-level hardware description languages that eventually synthesize DSAs on circuits. However, creating a high-quality HLS design still demands significant domain knowledge, particularly in microarchitecture decisions expressed as \\textit{pragmas}. Thus, it is desirable to automate such decisions with the help of machine learning for predicting the quality of HLS designs, requiring a deeper understanding of the program that consists of original code and pragmas. Naturally, these programs can be considered as sequence data. In addition, these programs can be compiled and converted into a control data flow graph (CDFG). But existing works either fail to leverage both modalities or combine the two in shallow or coarse ways. We propose ProgSG, a model that allows interaction between the source code sequence modality and the graph modality in a deep and fine-grained way. To alleviate the scarcity of labeled designs, a pre-training method is proposed based on a suite of compiler's data flow analysis tasks. Experimental results show that ProgSG reduces the RMSE of design performance predictions by up to $22\\%$, and identifies designs with an average of $1.10\\times$ and $1.26\\times$ (up to $8.17\\times$ and $13.31\\times$) performance improvement in design space exploration (DSE) task compared to HARP and AutoDSE, respectively.",

They have introduced or have been early adopters of programming language ideas such ideas as dynamic memory management, arbitrary precision arithmetic and dependent types. These systems have the feature of being highly complex while at the same time operating in a domain where results are well-defined and clearly verifiable. These software systems span multiple layers of abstraction with concerns ranging from instruction scheduling and cache pressure up to algorithmic complexity of constructions in algebraic geometry. All of the major symbolic mathematical computing systems include low-level code for arithmetic, memory management and other primitives, a compiler or interpreter for a bespoke programming language, a library of high level mathematical algorithms, and some form of user interface. Each of these parts invokes multiple deep issues.\n  We present some lessons learned from this environment and free flowing opinions on topics including:\n  * Portability of software across architectures and decades;\n  * Infrastructure to embrace and infrastructure to avoid;\n  * Choosing base abstractions upon which to build;\n  * How to get the most out of a small code base;\n  * How developments in compilers both to optimise and to validate code have always been and remain of critical importance, with plenty of remaining challenges;\n  * The way in which individuals including in particular Alan Mycroft who has been able to span from hand-crafting Z80 machine code up to the most abstruse high level code analysis techniques are needed, and\n  * Why it is important to teach full-stack thinking to the next generation.",

Besides the reference implementation, we also observe that other existing implementations are limited with respect to the features provided. In this work, we therefore propose the first version of a modern C++ implementation of CGP that pursues object-oriented design and generic programming paradigm to provide an efficient implementation model that can facilitate the discovery of new problem domains and the implementation of complex advanced methods that have been proposed for CGP over time.

The benchmark contains challenging code completion, understanding, and generation evaluation tasks with finely curated massively multilingual instruction corpora McEval-Instruct. In addition, we introduce an effective multilingual coder mCoder trained on McEval-Instruct to support multilingual programming language generation.

Furthermore, the language provides neither support for data exchange via MPI nor for arbitrary floating-point precision formats. If developers need to have a low memory footprint and MPI datatypes over structs which exchange only minimal data, they have to manipulate the data and to write MPI datatypes manually. We propose a C++ language extension based upon C++ attributes through which developers can guide the compiler what memory arrangements would be beneficial: Can multiple booleans be squeezed into one bit field, do floats hold fewer significant bits than in the IEEE standard, or does the code require a user-defined MPI datatype for certain subsets of attributes? The extension offers the opportunity to fall back to normal alignment and padding rules via plain C++ assignments, no dependencies upon external libraries are introduced, and the resulting code remains standard C++. Our work implements the language annotations within LLVM and demonstrates their potential impact, both upon the runtime and the memory footprint, through smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) benchmarks. They uncover the potential gains in terms of performance and development productivity.",

Historically, the general lack of statistical expertise and programming skills has stopped many with humanities or social sciences backgrounds from performing and fully benefiting from such analyses. Thus, we introduce Coconut Libtool (www.coconut-libtool.com/), an open-source, web-based application that utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. Coconut Libtool analyzes text data from customized files and bibliographic databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Lens. Users can verify which functions can be performed with the data they have. Coconut Libtool deploys multiple algorithmic NLP techniques at the backend, including topic modeling (LDA, Biterm, and BERTopic algorithms), network graph visualization, keyword lemmatization, and sunburst visualization. Coconut Libtool is the people-first web application designed to be used by professionals, researchers, and students in the information sciences, digital humanities, and computational social sciences domains to promote transparency, reproducibility, accessibility, reciprocity, and responsibility in research practices.",

        "Abstract": "Today's programmers can choose from an exceptional range of programming languages, each with its own traits, purpose, and complexity. A key aspect of a language's complexity is how hard it is to compile programs in the language. While most programmers have an intuition about compilation hardness for different programming languages, no metric exists to quantify it. We introduce the compilation quotient (CQ), a metric to quantify the compilation hardness of compiled programming languages. The key idea is to measure the compilation success rates of programs sampled from context-free grammars. To this end, we fairly sample over 12 million programs in total. CQ ranges between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates that no programs compile, and 100 means that all programs compile. Our findings on 12 popular compiled programming languages show high variation in CQ. C has a CQ of 48.11, C++ has 0.60, Java has 0.27 and Haskell has 0.13. Strikingly, Rust's CQ is nearly 0, and for C, even a large fraction of very sizable programs compile. We believe CQ can help understand the differences of compiled programming languages better and help language designers.",

However, its assembly-like syntax, implicit stack machine, and low-level data types make it extremely difficult for human developers to understand, spurring the need for effective WebAssembly reverse engineering techniques. In this paper, we propose StackSight, a novel neurosymbolic approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced program analysis to decompile complex WebAssembly code into readable C++ snippets. StackSight visualizes and tracks virtual stack alterations via a static analysis algorithm and then applies chain-of-thought prompting to harness LLM's complex reasoning capabilities. Evaluation results show that StackSight significantly improves WebAssembly decompilation. Our user study also demonstrates that code snippets generated by StackSight have significantly higher win rates and enable a better grasp of code semantics.",

To perform software testing, testers need to write code snippets that execute the program under test.

However, there remains a lack of fair comparisons between different LLMs in terms of test case generation capabilities.\n  In this paper, we propose TESTEVAL, a novel benchmark for test case generation with LLMs. We collect 210 Python programs from an online programming platform, LeetCode, and design three different tasks: overall coverage, targeted line/branch coverage, and targeted path coverage. We further evaluate sixteen popular LLMs, including both commercial and open-source ones, on TESTEVAL. We find that generating test cases to cover specific program lines/branches/paths is still challenging for current LLMs, indicating a lack of ability to comprehend program logic and execution paths.

While significant progress has been made in enhancing LLMs for popular programming languages, there exists a notable gap in comprehensive evaluation frameworks tailored for Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), particularly VHDL. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing LLM performance in VHDL code generation task. We construct a dataset for evaluating LLMs on VHDL code generation task. This dataset is constructed by translating a collection of Verilog evaluation problems to VHDL and aggregating publicly available VHDL problems, resulting in a total of 202 problems. To assess the functional correctness of the generated VHDL code, we utilize a curated set of self-verifying testbenches specifically designed for those aggregated VHDL problem set. We conduct an initial evaluation of different LLMs and their variants, including zero-shot code generation, in-context learning (ICL), and Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. Our findings underscore the considerable challenges faced by existing LLMs in VHDL code generation, revealing significant scope for improvement. This study emphasizes the necessity of supervised fine-tuning code generation models specifically for VHDL, offering potential benefits to VHDL designers seeking efficient code generation solutions.",

However, the recent introduction of machine learning (ML) into these domains has meant that ML models must be coded in these languages, or that complex software bridges have to be built between ML models in Python and these large compiled software systems. This is in contrast with recent progress in modern ML frameworks which aim to optimise both ease of use and high performance by harnessing hardware acceleration of tensor programs defined in Python. We introduce MESS: a modern electronic structure simulation package implemented in JAX; porting the ESS code to the ML world.

At its core, ShadowBound is an efficient out-of-bounds defense that can work with various use-after-free defenses (e.g. MarkUs, FFMalloc, PUMM) without compatibility constraints. We harness a shadow memory-based metadata management mechanism to store heap chunk boundaries and apply customized compiler optimizations tailored for boundary checking. We implemented ShadowBound atop the LLVM framework and integrated three state-of-the-art use-after-free defenses. Our evaluations show that ShadowBound provides robust heap protection with minimal time and memory overhead, suggesting its effectiveness and efficiency in safeguarding real-world programs against prevalent heap vulnerabilities.",

        "Abstract": "Large Code Generation Models (LCGMs) have garnered significant attention and achieved promising results across various programming tasks. However, concerns arise regarding performance when using non-English prompts, as these models are primarily trained on English-centric corpora, and most programming language tokens resemble English. Existing benchmarks often rely on English programming questions and limited manual unit test cases, inadequately assessing LCGM-generated code quality. This paper investigates code quality differences, specifically effectiveness and efficiency, when employing different natural languages as inputs, focusing on Chinese and English due to their prominent corpora and LCGM availability. Evaluating LCGM-generated code quality under bilingual inputs presents three challenges: (1) lack of high-quality bilingual programming question datasets, (2) insufficient unit test cases for comprehensive correctness verification, and (3) limited support for comparing generated code performance. To address these challenges, we curated a test suite of 52 bilingual programming questions and developed automated input generators for each. We enhanced correctness verification by sampling larger unit test cases and estimated code performance by profiling execution time relative to input size growth. Using this framework, we conducted an empirical study on six state-of-the-art LCGMs. The results revealed that LCGM-generated code exhibits varying bilingual correctness on an average of 10.5% of tasks, with 39.5% of correct code showing diverse bilingual performance differences. Our findings suggested LCGMs may not consistently generate high-quality code across different languages, providing insights for future research directions.",

The traditional RTL design workflow requires human experts to manually write high-quality RTL code, which is time-consuming and error-prone. With the help of emerging LLMs, developers can describe their requirements to LLMs which then generate corresponding code in Python, C, Java, and more. Adopting LLMs to generate RTL design in hardware description languages is not trivial, given the complex nature of hardware design and the generated design has to meet the timing and physical constraints.\n  We propose VeriAssist, an LLM-powered programming assistant for Verilog RTL design workflow. VeriAssist takes RTL design descriptions as input and generates high-quality RTL code with corresponding test benches. VeriAssist enables the LLM to self-correct and self-verify the generated code by adopting an automatic prompting system and integrating RTL simulator in the code generation loop. To generate an RTL design, VeriAssist first generates the initial RTL code and corresponding test benches, followed by a self-verification step that walks through the code with test cases to reason the code behavior at different time steps, and finally it self-corrects the code by reading the compilation and simulation results and generating final RTL code that fixes errors in compilation and simulation. This design fully leverages the LLMs' capabilities on multi-turn interaction and chain-of-thought reasoning to improve the quality of the generated code. We evaluate VeriAssist with various benchmark suites and find it significantly improves both syntax and functionality correctness over existing LLM implementations, thus minimizing human intervention and making RTL design more accessible to novice designers.",

        "Abstract": "The Large Language Model (LLM) watermark is a newly emerging technique that shows promise in addressing concerns surrounding LLM copyright, monitoring AI-generated text, and preventing its misuse. The LLM watermark scheme commonly includes generating secret keys to partition the vocabulary into green and red lists, applying a perturbation to the logits of tokens in the green list to increase their sampling likelihood, thus facilitating watermark detection to identify AI-generated text if the proportion of green tokens exceeds a threshold. However, recent research indicates that watermarking methods using numerous keys are susceptible to removal attacks, such as token editing, synonym substitution, and paraphrasing, with robustness declining as the number of keys increases. Therefore, the state-of-the-art watermark schemes that employ fewer or single keys have been demonstrated to be more robust against text editing and paraphrasing. In this paper, we propose a novel green list stealing attack against the state-of-the-art LLM watermark scheme and systematically examine its vulnerability to this attack. We formalize the attack as a mixed integer programming problem with constraints. We evaluate our attack under a comprehensive threat model, including an extreme scenario where the attacker has no prior knowledge, lacks access to the watermark detector API, and possesses no information about the LLM's parameter settings or watermark injection/detection scheme. Extensive experiments on LLMs, such as OPT and LLaMA, demonstrate that our attack can successfully steal the green list and remove the watermark across all settings.",

Its language characteristics make it trivial to accidentally introduce memory safety issues resulting in undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.

However, due to its relatively short lifespan, industry adaption in safety-critical environments is still lacking. This work provides a set of recommendations for the development of safety-critical space systems in Rust. Our recommendations are based on insights from our multi-fold contributions towards safer and more secure aerospace systems: We provide a comprehensive overview of ongoing efforts to adapt Rust for safety-critical system programming, highlighting its potential to enhance system robustness. Next, we introduce a procedure for partially rewriting C-based systems in Rust, offering a pragmatic pathway to improving safety without necessitating a full system overhaul. During the execution of our rewriting case study, we identify and fix three previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in a popular open-source satellite communication protocol. Finally, we introduce a new Rust compiler target configuration for bare metal PowerPC. With this, we aim to broaden Rust's applicability in space-oriented projects, as the architecture is commonly encountered in the domain, e.g., in the James Webb Space Telescope.",

To address this limitation, we introduce AbstractBeam: a novel program synthesis framework designed to enhance LambdaBeam by leveraging Library Learning. AbstractBeam identifies and integrates recurring program structures into the DSL, optimizing the synthesis process. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that AbstractBeam statistically significantly (p < 0.05) outperforms LambdaBeam in the integer list manipulation domain. Beyond solving more tasks, AbstractBeam's program synthesis is also more efficient, requiring less time and fewer candidate programs to generate a solution.

        "Abstract": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the diversity of multi-LLM tasks and the variability in their pricing structures have become increasingly important, as costs can vary greatly between different LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the \\textit{C2MAB-V}, a \\underline{C}ost-effective \\underline{C}ombinatorial \\underline{M}ulti-armed \\underline{B}andit with \\underline{V}ersatile reward models for optimal LLM selection and usage. This online model differs from traditional static approaches or those reliant on a single LLM without cost consideration. With multiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to handling user queries, \\textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple LLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various collaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed online feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \\textit{C2MAB-V} can effectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also balancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear programming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is addressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the local server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides optimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online updates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \\textit{C2MAB-V} offers strict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art results for regret and violations in some degenerate cases. Empirically, we show that \\textit{C2MAB-V} effectively balances performance and cost-efficiency with nine LLMs for three application scenarios.",

Despite promising outcomes, current state-of-the-art PRL methods are hindered by sample inefficiency, necessitating tens of millions of program-environment interactions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel LLM-guided search framework (LLM-GS). Our key insight is to leverage the programming expertise and common sense reasoning of LLMs to enhance the efficiency of assumption-free, random-guessing search methods. We address the challenge of LLMs' inability to generate precise and grammatically correct programs in domain-specific languages (DSLs) by proposing a Pythonic-DSL strategy - an LLM is instructed to initially generate Python codes and then convert them into DSL programs. To further optimize the LLM-generated programs, we develop a search algorithm named Scheduled Hill Climbing, designed to efficiently explore the programmatic search space to consistently improve the programs. Experimental results in the Karel domain demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our LLM-GS framework. Extensive ablation studies further verify the critical role of our Pythonic-DSL strategy and Scheduled Hill Climbing algorithm.",

As these technologies evolve rapidly, it is crucial to explore how they influence code generation, especially given the risk of misuse in areas like higher education. This paper explores this issue by using advanced classification techniques to differentiate between code written by humans and that generated by ChatGPT, a type of LLM. We employ a new approach that combines powerful embedding features (black-box) with supervised learning algorithms - including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting - to achieve this differentiation with an impressive accuracy of 98%. For the successful combinations, we also examine their model calibration, showing that some of the models are extremely well calibrated. Additionally, we present white-box features and an interpretable Bayes classifier to elucidate critical differences between the code sources, enhancing the explainability and transparency of our approach. Both approaches work well but provide at most 85-88% accuracy. We also show that untrained humans solve the same task not better than random guessing. This study is crucial in understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with using AI in code generation, particularly in the context of higher education, software development, and competitive programming.",

Existing approaches overcome the programming limitations with no-code authoring through drag and drop, however they assume that educators possess the necessary skills to design effective and engaging tutor interfaces. To address this assumption we introduce generative AI capabilities to assist educators in creating tutor interfaces that meet their needs while adhering to design principles. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to generate tutor layout and contents based on high-level requirements provided by educators as inputs. However, to allow them to actively participate in the design process, rather than relying entirely on AI-generated solutions, we allow generation both at the entire interface level and at the individual component level. The former provides educators with a complete interface that can be refined using direct manipulation, while the latter offers the ability to create specific elements to be added to the tutor interface. A small-scale comparison shows the potential of our approach to enhance the efficiency of tutor interface design. Moving forward, we raise critical questions for assisting educators with generative AI capabilities to create personalized, effective, and engaging tutors, ultimately enhancing their adoption.",

        "Abstract": "This paper explores practical aspects of using a high-level functional language for GPU-based arithmetic on ``midsize'' integers. By this we mean integers of up to about a quarter million bits, which is sufficient for most practical purposes. The goal is to understand whether it is possible to support efficient nested-parallel programs with a small, flexible code base. We report on GPU implementations for addition and multiplication of integers that fit in one CUDA block, thus leveraging temporal reuse from scratchpad memories. Our key contribution resides in the simplicity of the proposed solutions: We recognize that addition is a straightforward application of scan, which is known to allow efficient GPU implementation. For quadratic multiplication we employ a simple work-partitioning strategy that offers good temporal locality. For FFT multiplication, we efficiently map the computation in the domain of integral fields by finding ``good'' primes that enable almost-full utilization of machine words. In comparison, related work uses complex tiling strategies -- which feel too big a hammer for the job -- or uses the computational domain of reals, which may degrade the magnitude of the base in which the computation is carried. We evaluate the performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art CGBN library, authored by NvidiaLab, and report that our CUDA prototype outperforms CGBN for integer sizes higher than 32K bits, while offering comparable performance for smaller sizes. Moreover, we are, to our knowledge, the first to report that FFT multiplication outperforms the classical one on the larger sizes that still fit in a CUDA block. Finally, we examine Futhark's strengths and weaknesses for efficiently supporting such computations and find out that a compiler pass aimed at efficient sequentialization of excess parallelism would significantly improve performance.",

Prior research studies have shown the importance of EBTs, but those studies also highlighted that developers put most of their efforts on \"happy paths\", e.g., paths without unwanted events. To help developers fill the gap, we present the first framework, dubbed exLong, that automatically generates EBTs. exLong is a large language model instruction-tuned from CodeLlama and embeds reasoning about traces that lead to throw statements, conditional expressions that guard throw statements, and non-exceptional behavior tests that execute similar traces. We compare exLong with the state-of-the-art models for test generation (CAT-LM) and one of the strongest foundation models (GPT3.5), as well as with analysis-based tools for test generation (Randoop and EvoSuite). Our results show that exLong outperforms existing models and tools. Furthermore, we contributed several pull requests to open-source projects and 23 EBTs generated by exLong were already accepted.",

        "Abstract": "Software security continues to be a critical concern for programs implemented in low-level programming languages such as C and C++. Many defenses have been proposed in the current literature, each with different trade-offs including performance, compatibility, and attack resistance. One general class of defense is pointer randomization or authentication, where invalid object access (e.g., memory errors) is obfuscated or denied. Many defenses rely on the program termination (e.g., crashing) to abort attacks, with the implicit assumption that an adversary cannot \"brute force\" the defense with multiple attack attempts. However, such assumptions do not always hold, such as hardware speculative execution attacks or network servers configured to restart on error. In such cases, we argue that most existing defenses provide only weak effective security.\n  In this paper, we propose Fully Randomized Pointers (FRP) as a stronger memory error defense that is resistant to even brute force attacks. The key idea is to fully randomize pointer bits -- as much as possible while also preserving binary compatibility -- rendering the relationships between pointers highly unpredictable. Furthermore, the very high degree of randomization renders brute force attacks impractical -- providing strong effective security compared to existing work. We design a new FRP encoding that is: (1) compatible with existing binary code (without recompilation); (2) decoupled from the underlying object layout; and (3) can be efficiently decoded on-the-fly to the underlying memory address. We prototype FRP in the form of a software implementation (BlueFat) to test security and compatibility, and a proof-of-concept hardware implementation (GreenFat) to evaluate performance. We show that FRP is secure, practical, and compatible at the binary level, while a hardware implementation can achieve low performance overheads (<10%).",

Whether AoS or SoA is favourable depends on the execution context and algorithm step. We propose a language extension based upon C++ attributes through which developers can guide the compiler what memory arrangements are to be used. The compiler can then automatically convert (parts of) the data into the format of choice prior to a calculation and convert results back afterwards. As all conversions are merely annotations, it is straightforward for the developer to experiment with different storage formats and to pick subsets of data that are subject to memory rearrangements. Our work implements the annotations within Clang and demonstrates their potential impact through a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code.",

We conduct our study on code extracted from real-world open source projects. To enable our study, we develop FLOURINE, an end-to-end code translation tool that uses differential fuzzing to check if a Rust translation is I/O equivalent to the original source program, eliminating the need for pre-existing test cases. As part of our investigation, we assess both the LLM's ability to produce an initially successful translation, as well as their capacity to fix a previously generated buggy one. If the original and the translated programs are not I/O equivalent, we apply a set of automated feedback strategies, including feedback to the LLM with counterexamples. Our results show that the most successful LLM can translate 47% of our benchmarks, and also provides insights into next steps for improvements.",

Identifying actors that deceitfully utilize an API poses a demanding problem. Although there have been notable advancements and contributions in the field of API security, there remains a significant challenge when dealing with attackers who use novel approaches that don't match the well-known payloads commonly seen in attacks. Also, attackers may exploit standard functionalities unconventionally and with objectives surpassing their intended boundaries. Thus, API security needs to be more sophisticated and dynamic than ever, with advanced computational intelligence methods, such as machine learning models that can quickly identify and respond to abnormal behavior. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised few-shot anomaly detection framework composed of two main parts: First, we train a dedicated generic language model for API based on FastText embedding. Next, we use Approximate Nearest Neighbor search in a classification-by-retrieval approach. Our framework allows for training a fast, lightweight classification model using only a few examples of normal API requests. We evaluated the performance of our framework using the CSIC 2010 and ATRDF 2023 datasets. The results demonstrate that our framework improves API attack detection accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) unsupervised anomaly detection baselines.",

Enterprises and startups increasingly build their distributed systems on the cloud due to its many advantages, such as scalability and cost-effectiveness. One of the first technical questions companies face when building a system on the cloud is which programming language to use. Among many factors that go into this decision is whether to use a language with garbage collection (GC), such as Java or Go, or a language with manual memory management, such as C++ or Rust. Today, companies predominantly prefer languages with GC, like Go, Kotlin, or even Python, due to ease of development; however, there is no free lunch: GC costs resources (memory and CPU) and performance (long tail latencies due to GC pauses). While there have been anecdotal reports of reduced cloud cost and improved tail latencies when switching from a language with GC to a language with manual memory management, so far, there has not been a systematic study of the GC overhead of running an SMR-based cloud system.\n  This paper studies the overhead of running an SMR-based cloud system written in a language with GC. To this end, we design from scratch a canonical SMR system -- a MultiPaxos-based replicated in-memory key-value store -- and we implement it in C++, Java, Rust, and Go. We compare the performance and resource usage of these implementations when running on the cloud under different workloads and resource constraints and report our results.

Formulations of proof production and proof checking already exist on top of the state-of-the-art Marabou DNN verifier. The native implementation of the proof checking algorithm for Marabou was done in C++ and itself raised the question of trust in the code (e.g., in the precision of floating point calculations or guarantees for implementation soundness).

        "Abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely-used parameter-efficient finetuning method for large language models. LoRA saves memory by training only low rank perturbations to selected weight matrices. In this work, we compare the performance of LoRA and full finetuning on two target domains, programming and mathematics. We consider both the instruction finetuning (approximately 100K prompt-response pairs) and continued pretraining (20B unstructured tokens) data regimes. Our results show that, in the standard low-rank settings, LoRA substantially underperforms full finetuning. Nevertheless, LoRA better maintains the base model's performance on tasks outside the target domain. We show that LoRA mitigates forgetting more than common regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout; it also helps maintain more diverse generations. Finally, we show that full finetuning learns perturbations with a rank that is 10-100X greater than typical LoRA configurations, possibly explaining some of the reported gaps. We conclude by proposing best practices for finetuning with LoRA.",

Developed with the Blueprint visual language within Epic Games' Unreal Engine, AKN_Regie offers a user interface accessible to non-programming artists. This feature will be used to describe two perspectives of appropriation of the tool: the Plugin perspective for these users and the Blueprint perspective for programming artists who want to improve the tool. These two perspectives are then completed by a C++ perspective that aligns AKN_Regie with the language with which the engine itself is programmed. The circulations between these three perspectives are finally studied by drawing on work on the ecology of collective intelligence.",

However, leveraging GenAI models in code today can be complex, counter-intuitive and often require specialized frameworks, leading to increased complexity. This is because it is currently unclear as to the right abstractions through which we should marry GenAI models with the nature of traditional programming code constructs. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel abstractions to help bridge the gap between Neuro- and symbolic programming. We introduce Meaning, a new specialized type that represents the underlying semantic value of traditional types (e.g., string). We make the case that GenAI models, LLMs in particular, should be reasoned as a meaning-type wrapped code construct at the language level. We formulate the problem of translation between meaning and traditional types and propose Automatic Meaning-Type Transformation (A-MTT), a runtime feature that abstracts this translation away from the developers by automatically converting between M eaning and types at the interface of LLM invocation. Leveraging this new set of code constructs and OTT, we demonstrate example implementation of neurosymbolic programs that seamlessly utilizes LLMs to solve problems in place of potentially complex traditional programming logic.",

Our industrial partner is required to use SDKs that support only older C++ language editions. They, however, would like to allow their developers to use the newest language constructs in their code. To address this problem, we created a source code transformation framework to automatically backport source code written according to the C++11 standard to its functionally equivalent C++03 variant. With our framework developers are free to exploit the latest language features, while production code is still built by using a restricted set of available language constructs. This paper reports on the technical details of the transformation engine, and our experiences in applying it on two large industrial code bases and four open-source systems.

SonifyAR expands the current design space of AR sound and implements a Programming by Demonstration (PbD) pipeline to automatically collect contextual information of AR events, including virtual content semantics and real world context. This context information is then processed by a large language model to acquire sound effects with Recommendation, Retrieval, Generation, and Transfer methods.

However, in the semiconductor industry, utilising LLMs to debug Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is still insufficient, largely due to the underrepresentation of RTL-specific data in training sets. This work introduces a novel framework, Make Each Iteration Count (MEIC), which contrasts with traditional one-shot LLM-based debugging methods that heavily rely on prompt engineering, model tuning, and model training. MEIC utilises LLMs in an iterative process to overcome the limitation of LLMs in RTL code debugging, which is suitable for identifying and correcting both syntax and function errors, while effectively managing the uncertainties inherent in LLM operations. To evaluate our framework, we provide an open-source dataset comprising 178 common RTL programming errors. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed debugging framework achieves fix rate of 93% for syntax errors and 78% for function errors, with up to 48x speedup in debugging processes when compared with experienced engineers.

For example, recent work in programming education has used LLMs to generate learning resources, improve error messages, and provide feedback on code. However, one factor that limits progress within the field is that much of the research uses bespoke datasets and different evaluation metrics, making direct comparisons between results unreliable. Thus, there is a pressing need for standardization and benchmarks that facilitate the equitable comparison of competing approaches. One task where LLMs show great promise is program repair, which can be used to provide debugging support and next-step hints to students. In this article, we propose a novel educational program repair benchmark. We curate two high-quality publicly available programming datasets, present a unified evaluation procedure introducing a novel evaluation metric rouge@k for approximating the quality of repairs, and evaluate a set of five recent models to establish baseline performance.",

However, concerns have been voiced around the privacy and ethical implications of sending student work to proprietary models. This has sparked considerable interest in the use of open source LLMs in education, but the quality of the feedback that such open models can produce remains understudied. This is a concern as providing flawed or misleading generated feedback could be detrimental to student learning. Inspired by recent work that has utilised very powerful LLMs, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the outputs produced by less powerful models, we conduct an automated analysis of the quality of the feedback produced by several open source models using a dataset from an introductory programming course. First, we investigate the viability of employing GPT-4 as an automated evaluator by comparing its evaluations with those of a human expert. We observe that GPT-4 demonstrates a bias toward positively rating feedback while exhibiting moderate agreement with human raters, showcasing its potential as a feedback evaluator. Second, we explore the quality of feedback generated by several leading open-source LLMs by using GPT-4 to evaluate the feedback. We find that some models offer competitive performance with popular proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT, indicating opportunities for their responsible use in educational settings.",

        "Abstract": "Context. Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LLMs recently became essential to increase the productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software development. Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software. However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools. Released in August 2023, Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools.\n  Goal. In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code.\n  Method. We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python. We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures. Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency.\n  Results. Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand. Also, human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart. Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of generated code.\n  Conclusions. According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so. Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development.",

The complexities associated with querying large-scale multi-table databases require specialized programming expertise and labor-intensive development. Additionally, traditional analysis methods have focused mainly on numerical data, often neglecting the semantic aspects that could enhance interpretability and understanding. Furthermore, real-time traffic data access is typically limited due to privacy concerns. To bridge this gap, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the domain of traffic management presents a transformative approach to addressing the complexities and challenges inherent in modern transportation systems. This paper proposes an intelligent online chatbot, TP-GPT, for efficient customized transportation surveillance and management empowered by a large real-time traffic database. The innovative framework leverages contextual and generative intelligence of language models to generate accurate SQL queries and natural language interpretations by employing transportation-specialized prompts, Chain-of-Thought prompting, few-shot learning, multi-agent collaboration strategy, and chat memory. Experimental study demonstrates that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as GPT-4 and PaLM 2 on a challenging traffic-analysis benchmark TransQuery. TP-GPT would aid researchers and practitioners in real-time transportation surveillance and management in a privacy-preserving, equitable, and customizable manner.",

Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model. Various experiments and ablations are done on four datasets including both the C++ and python languages to validate the hard meta-graph prompt, the soft prompting technique, and the effectiveness of the objectives for pretrained GNN expert. CodeGRAG improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

Researchers have previously proposed several automated test case generation approaches for PLC software applying symbolic execution and search-based techniques. Often requiring formal specifications and performing a mechanical analysis of programs, these approaches may uncover specific programming errors but sometimes suffer from state space explosion and cannot process rather informal specifications. We proposed a novel approach for the automatic generation of PLC test cases that queries a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize test cases for code provided in a prompt. Experiments with ten open-source function blocks from the OSCAT automation library showed that the approach is fast, easy to use, and can yield test cases with high statement coverage for low-to-medium complex programs. However, we also found that LLM-generated test cases suffer from erroneous assertions in many cases, which still require manual adaption.",

        "Abstract": "Originating from semantic bugs, Entity-Inconsistency Bugs (EIBs) involve misuse of syntactically valid yet incorrect program entities, such as variable identifiers and function names, which often have security implications. Unlike straightforward syntactic vulnerabilities, EIBs are subtle and can remain undetected for years. Traditional detection methods, such as static analysis and dynamic testing, often fall short due to the versatile and context-dependent nature of EIBs. However, with advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, we believe LLM-powered automatic EIB detection becomes increasingly feasible through these models' semantics understanding abilities. This research first undertakes a systematic measurement of LLMs' capabilities in detecting EIBs, revealing that GPT-4, while promising, shows limited recall and precision that hinder its practical application. The primary problem lies in the model's tendency to focus on irrelevant code snippets devoid of EIBs. To address this, we introduce a novel, cascaded EIB detection system named WitheredLeaf, which leverages smaller, code-specific language models to filter out most negative cases and mitigate the problem, thereby significantly enhancing the overall precision and recall. We evaluated WitheredLeaf on 154 Python and C GitHub repositories, each with over 1,000 stars, identifying 123 new flaws, 45% of which can be exploited to disrupt the program's normal operations. Out of 69 submitted fixes, 27 have been successfully merged.",

        "Abstract": "LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in code generation tasks, achieving promising results at the function or statement level across various benchmarks. However, the complexities associated with creating code artifacts like classes, particularly within the context of real-world software repositories, remain underexplored. Prior research treats class-level generation as an isolated task, neglecting the intricate dependencies & interactions that characterize real-world software environments. To address this gap, we introduce RepoClassBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs in generating complex, class-level code within real-world repositories. RepoClassBench includes \"Natural Language to Class generation\" tasks across Java, Python & C# from a selection of repositories. We ensure that each class in our dataset not only has cross-file dependencies within the repository but also includes corresponding test cases to verify its functionality. We find that current models struggle with the realistic challenges posed by our benchmark, primarily due to their limited exposure to relevant repository contexts. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Retrieve-Repotools-Reflect (RRR), a novel approach that equips LLMs with static analysis tools to iteratively navigate & reason about repository-level context in an agent-based framework. Our experiments demonstrate that RRR significantly outperforms existing baselines on RepoClassBench, showcasing its effectiveness across programming languages & under various settings. Our findings emphasize the critical need for code-generation benchmarks to incorporate repo-level dependencies to more accurately reflect the complexities of software development. Our work shows the benefits of leveraging specialized tools to enhance LLMs' understanding of repository context. We plan to make our dataset & evaluation harness public.",

        "Abstract": "Teaching programming in early childhood (4-9) to enhance computational thinking has gained popularity in the recent movement of computer science for all. However, current practices ignore some fundamental issues resulting from young children's developmental readiness, such as the sustained capability to keyboarding, the decomposition of complex tasks to small tasks, the need for intuitive mapping from abstract programming to tangible outcomes, and the limited amount of screen time exposure. To address these issues in this paper, we present a novel methodology with an AI-powered integration platform to effectively teach computational thinking for young children. The system features a hybrid pedagogy that supports both the top-down and bottom-up approach for teaching computational thinking. Young children can describe their desired task in natural language, while the system can respond with an easy-to-understand program consisting of the right level of decomposed sub-tasks. A tangible robot can immediately execute the decomposed program and demonstrate the program's outcomes to young children. The system is equipped with an intelligent chatbot that can interact with young children through natural languages, and children can speak to the chatbot to complete all the needed programming tasks, while the chatbot orchestrates the execution of the program onto the robot. This would completely eliminates the need of keyboards for young children to program. By developing such a system, we aim to make the concept of computational thinking more accessible to young children, fostering a natural understanding of programming concepts without the need of explicit programming skills. Through the interactive experience provided by the robotic agent, our system seeks to engage children in an effective manner, contributing to the field of educational technology for early childhood computer science education.",

        "Abstract": "Code generation aims to synthesize code and fulfill functional requirements based on natural language (NL) specifications, which can greatly improve development efficiency. In the era of large language models (LLMs), large code models (LCMs) have been recently proposed to generate source code. LCMs can generate highly feasible solutions for programming problems described in natural language. Despite the effectiveness, we observe a noticeable multilingual bias in the generation performance of LCMs. Specifically, LCMs demonstrate proficiency in generating solutions when provided with instructions in English, yet may falter when faced with semantically equivalent instructions in other NLs such as Chinese. Moreover, the ability of LCMs to generate code exhibits variety across different programming languages (PLs), such as Python and C++. The observed phenomenon indicates the presence of multi-lingual bias within the generative capabilities of LCMs, which has remained unexplored.\n  In this paper, we aim to investigate the multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs. First, we initiate our investigation by constructing the first multi-lingual evaluation benchmark X-HumanEval-X, enabling us to systematically evaluate the extent of multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs. In our large-scale experiments on nine popular LCMs, we observe a pronounced multi-lingual bias of LCMs in code generation, including multi-NL and multi-PL bias. Specifically, when using Chinese instructions, the code generation capabilities of LCMs decrease by at least 13% in terms of the Pass@1 metric. Furthermore, LCMs perform variously across different programming languages, e.g., the performance gap between Python and C++ reaches as high as 20.9%. ...",

        "Abstract": "Rust is a programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control, providing C-like performance while guaranteeing the absence of undefined behaviors by default. Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust. Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based. While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to the original, they often yield unreadable Rust code that uses unsafe subsets of the Rust language. On the other hand, while LLM-based approaches typically produce more readable, maintainable, and safe code, they do not provide any guarantees about correctness. In this work, we present VERT, a tool that can produce readable Rust transpilations with formal guarantees of correctness. VERT's only requirement is that there is Web Assembly compiler for the source language, which is true for most major languages. VERT first uses the Web Assembly compiler to obtain an oracle Rust program. In parallel, VERT uses an LLM to generate a readable candidate Rust program. This candidate is verified against the oracle, and if verification fails, we regenerate a new candidate transpilation until verification succeeds. We evaluate VERT by transpiling a suite of 1,394 programs taken from competitive programming style benchmarks. Combining Anthropic's Claude-2 and VERT increases Rust transpilations passing property-based testing from 31% to 54% and bounded model-checking from 1% to 42% compared to using Claude alone. In addition, we evaluate VERT's ability to generate non-trivial safe Rust on programs taken from real-world C projects that make significant use of pointers. Our results provide insights into the limitations of LLMs to write safe Rust.",

        "Abstract": "Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely high-dimensional combinatorial and nonlinear hypothesis spaces. Traditional methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the rich domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data in an efficient manner. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its physical understanding, which are then optimized against data to estimate skeleton parameters. We demonstrate LLM-SR's effectiveness across three diverse scientific domains, where it discovers physically accurate equations that provide significantly better fits to in-domain and out-of-domain data compared to the well-established symbolic regression baselines. Incorporating scientific prior knowledge also enables LLM-SR to search the equation space more efficiently than baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/deep-symbolic-mathematics/LLM-SR",

We address a significant gap in the literature concerning the security properties of code produced by these models without specific directives. N. Tihanyi et al. introduced the FormAI dataset at PROMISE '23, containing 112,000 GPT-3.5-generated C programs, with over 51.24% identified as vulnerable. We expand that work by introducing the FormAI-v2 dataset comprising 265,000 compilable C programs generated using various LLMs, including robust models such as Google's GEMINI-pro, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, to Meta's specialized 13 billion-parameter CodeLLama2 and various other compact models. Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC). This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process. Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable. The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations. Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires risk assessment and validation.",

        "Abstract": "Tensor processing infrastructures such as deep learning frameworks and specialized hardware accelerators have revolutionized how computationally intensive code from domains such as deep learning and image processing is executed and optimized. These infrastructures provide powerful and expressive abstractions while ensuring high performance. However, to utilize them, code must be written specifically using the APIs / ISAs of such software frameworks or hardware accelerators. Importantly, given the fast pace of innovation in these domains, code written today quickly becomes legacy as new frameworks and accelerators are developed, and migrating such legacy code manually is a considerable effort.\n  To enable developers in leveraging such DSLs while preserving their current programming paradigm, we introduce Tenspiler, a verified lifting-based compiler that uses program synthesis to translate sequential programs written in general-purpose programming languages (e.g., C++ or Python code) into tensor operations. Central to Tenspiler is our carefully crafted yet simple intermediate language, named TensIR, that expresses tensor operations. TensIR enables efficient lifting, verification, and code generation.\n  Currently, Tenspiler already supports \\textbf{six} DSLs, spanning a broad spectrum of software and hardware environments. Furthermore, we show that new backends can be easily supported by Tenspiler by adding simple pattern-matching rules for TensIR. Using 10 real-world code benchmark suites, our experimental evaluation shows that by translating code to be executed on \\textbf{6} different software frameworks and hardware devices, Tenspiler offers on average 105$\\times$ kernel and 9.65$\\times$ end-to-end execution time improvement over the fully-optimized sequential implementation of the same benchmarks.",

However, many legacy revisions often cannot be successfully compiled due to changes in the programming language or tools used in the compilation process, adding complexity and preventing automation in the bisection process.\n  Objective: In this paper, we introduce an approach to repair test cases of Java projects by performing dependency minimization. Our approach aims to remove classes and methods that are not required for the execution of one or more test cases. Unlike existing state-of-the-art techniques, our approach performs minimization at source-level, which allows compile-time errors to be fixed.\n  Method: A standalone Java tool implementing our technique was developed, and we evaluated our technique using subjects from Defects4J retargeted against Java 8 and 17.\n  Results: Our evaluation showed that a majority of subjects can be repaired solely by performing minimization, including replicating the test results of the original version. Furthermore, our technique is also shown to achieve accurate minimized results, while only adding a small overhead to the bisection process.\n  Conclusion: Our proposed technique is shown to be effective for repairing build failures with minimal overhead, making it suitable for use in automated bug bisection. Our tool can also be adapted for use cases such as bug corpus creation and refactoring.",

But this speed gain shall not come free of cost, there is going to be a trade-off between speed and efficiency, i.e accuracy of the computation. In order to achieve this extra speed we will simply have to let our computers make more mistakes in computations. Consequently, systems built with these type of chips will possess an innate unreliability lying within. Programs written for these systems will also have to incorporate this unreliability. Researchers have already started developing programming frameworks for unreliable architectures as such.\n  In the present work, we use a restricted version of C-type languages to model the programs written for unreliable architectures. We propose a technique for statically analyzing codes written for these kind of architectures. Our technique, which primarily focuses on Interval/Range Analysis of this type of programs, uses the well established theory of abstract interpretation. While discussing unreliability of hardware, there comes scope of failure of the hardware components implicitly. There are two types of failure models, namely: 1) permanent failure model, where the hardware stops execution on failure and 2) transient failure model, where on failure, the hardware continues subsequent operations with wrong operand values. In this paper, we've only taken transient failure model into consideration. The goal of this analysis is to predict the probability with which a program variable assumes values from a given range at a given program point.",

However, arrays in these, and almost all prominent systems, can only handle dense rectilinear integer grids. Real world arrays often contain underlying structure, such as sparsity, runs of repeated values, or symmetry. Support for structured data is fragmented and incomplete. Existing frameworks limit the array structures and program control flow they support to better simplify the problem.\n  In this work, we propose a new programming language, Finch, which supports both flexible control flow and diverse data structures. Finch facilitates a programming model which resolves the challenges of computing over structured arrays by combining control flow and data structures into a common representation where they can be co-optimized. Finch automatically specializes control flow to data so that performance engineers can focus on experimenting with many algorithms. Finch supports a familiar programming language of loops, statements, ifs, breaks, etc., over a wide variety of array structures, such as sparsity, run-length-encoding, symmetry, triangles, padding, or blocks. Finch reliably utilizes the key properties of structure, such as structural zeros, repeated values, or clustered non-zeros. We show that this leads to dramatic speedups in operations such as SpMV and SpGEMM, image processing, graph analytics, and a high-level tensor operator fusion interface.",

Current methods mainly focus on detecting single functions (i.e., intra-procedural vulnerabilities), ignoring the more complex inter-procedural vulnerability detection scenarios in practice. For example, developers routinely engage with program analysis to detect vulnerabilities that span multiple functions within repositories. In addition, the widely-used benchmark datasets generally contain only intra-procedural vulnerabilities, leaving the assessment of inter-procedural vulnerability detection capabilities unexplored.\n  To mitigate the issues, we propose a repository-level evaluation system, named \\textbf{VulEval}, aiming at evaluating the detection performance of inter- and intra-procedural vulnerabilities simultaneously. Specifically, VulEval consists of three interconnected evaluation tasks: \\textbf{(1) Function-Level Vulnerability Detection}, aiming at detecting intra-procedural vulnerability given a code snippet; \\textbf{(2) Vulnerability-Related Dependency Prediction}, aiming at retrieving the most relevant dependencies from call graphs for providing developers with explanations about the vulnerabilities; and \\textbf{(3) Repository-Level Vulnerability Detection}, aiming at detecting inter-procedural vulnerabilities by combining with the dependencies identified in the second task. VulEval also consists of a large-scale dataset, with a total of 4,196 CVE entries, 232,239 functions, and corresponding 4,699 repository-level source code in C/C++ programming languages.

As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka. rubber duck debugging). However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs execute at run-time. To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales. Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation. Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 14.3% absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated metrics and human raters. Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent at test-time.",

Such unintended execution of benign program-defined handlers in an enclave corrupts its state and violates execution integrity. 7 runtimes and library OSes (OpenEnclave, Gramine, Scone, Asylo, Teaclave, Occlum, EnclaveOS) are vulnerable to SIGY. 8 languages supported in Intel SGX have programming constructs that are vulnerable to SIGY. We use SIGY to demonstrate 4 proof of concept exploits on webservers (Nginx, Node.js) to leak secrets and data analytics workloads in different languages (C and Java) to break execution integrity.",

        "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on a broad spectrum of downstream tasks. Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks are however generally overlooking the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches.\n  We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on C++ and Java repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 7.6% to 10% in Top-10 repair suggestions. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the incumbent state-of-the-art in fine-tuned models for program repair, Fine-tune-CoT and RepairLLaMA.",

These Questions about Learners' Code (QLCs) are created through program analysis, exploring execution paths, and then creating code comprehension questions from these paths and the broader code structure. Responding to the questions requires reading and tracing the code, which is known to support students' learning. At the same time, computing education researchers have witnessed the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) that have taken the community by storm. Researchers have demonstrated the applicability of these models especially in the introductory programming context, outlining their performance in solving introductory programming problems and their utility in creating new learning resources. In this work, we explore the capability of the state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in answering QLCs that are generated from code that the LLMs have created. Our results show that although the state-of-the-art LLMs can create programs and trace program execution when prompted, they easily succumb to similar errors that have previously been recorded for novice programmers. These results demonstrate the fallibility of these models and perhaps dampen the expectations fueled by the recent LLM hype. At the same time, we also highlight future research possibilities such as using LLMs to mimic students as their behavior can indeed be similar for some specific tasks.",

This paper presents a systematic investigation into the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for repairing declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We propose a novel repair pipeline that integrates a dual-agent LLM framework, comprising a Repair Agent and a Prompt Agent. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of LLM-based repair with state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. Our study reveals that LLMs, particularly GPT-4 variants, outperform existing techniques in terms of repair efficacy, albeit with a marginal increase in runtime and token usage.

Despite their progress, existing text-to-vis models often heavily rely on lexical matching between words in the questions and tokens in data schemas. This overreliance on lexical matching may lead to a diminished level of model robustness against input variations. In this study, we thoroughly examine the robustness of current text-to-vis models, an area that has not previously been explored. In particular, we construct the first robustness dataset nvBench-Rob, which contains diverse lexical and phrasal variations based on the original text-to-vis benchmark nvBench. Then, we found that the performance of existing text-to-vis models on this new dataset dramatically drops, implying that these methods exhibit inadequate robustness overall. Finally, we propose a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, named GRED, specifically designed to address input perturbations in these two variants. The framework consists of three parts: NLQ-Retrieval Generator, Visualization Query-Retrieval Retuner and Annotation-based Debugger, which are used to tackle the challenges posed by natural language variants, programming style differences and data schema variants, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model RGVisNet in the Text-to-Vis field, GRED performs better in terms of model robustness, with a 32% increase in accuracy on the proposed nvBench-Rob dataset.",

This enables rapid prototyping and fine-tuning runtime behavior and memory management. A flexible type system and additional safety guarantees help to prevent programming errors.\n  By exploiting C++'s template metaprogramming capabilities, this has (near) zero overhead, as only required code paths are generated at compile time.\n  We demonstrate that our library is a strong foundation for a future distributed standard library using multiple application benchmarks, ranging from text-book sorting algorithms to phylogenetic interference.",

This is very convenient for developing formal definitions and proofs for professional users, but it makes propositions more difficult to read for non-professional users, e.g. students of a program semantics course. We develop a small Coq library of sets and relations so that standard math notations can be used when teaching denotational semantics of simple imperative languages. This library is developed using Coq's type class system. It brings about zero proof-term overhead comparing with the existing formalization of sets.",

Such systems integrate multiple computing accelerators and memory units to deliver higher performance than CPU-centric systems. Although heterogeneous systems have been adopted by modern workloads such as machine learning, programming remains a critical limiting factor. Conventional heterogeneous programming techniques either impose heavy modifications to the code base or require rewriting the program in a different language. Such programming complexity stems from the lack of a unified abstraction layer for computing and data exchange, which forces each programming model to define its abstractions. However, with the emerging cache-coherent interconnections such as Compute Express Link, we see an opportunity to standardize such architecture heterogeneity and provide a unified programming model. We present CodeFlow, a language runtime system for heterogeneous computing. CodeFlow abstracts architecture computation in programming language runtime and utilizes CXL as a unified data exchange protocol. Workloads written in high-level languages such as C++ and Rust can be compiled to CodeFlow, which schedules different parts of the workload to suitable accelerators without requiring the developer to implement code or call APIs for specific accelerators. CodeFlow reduces programmers' effort in utilizing heterogeneous systems and improves workload performance.",

We employ both automated and manual approaches to effectively detect security API misuse in the code generated by ChatGPT for these tasks. Our findings are concerning: around 70% of the code instances across 30 attempts per task contain security API misuse, with 20 distinct misuse types identified. Moreover, for roughly half of the tasks, this rate reaches 100%, indicating that there is a long way to go before developers can rely on ChatGPT to securely implement security API code.",

        "Abstract": "Memory safety violations in low-level code, written in languages like C, continues to remain one of the major sources of software vulnerabilities. One method of removing such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C dialect. Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead. This porting, however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of this technique.\n  The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations, but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make it amenable to such annotations. In this paper, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing both these concerns. We show how to harness LLM capabilities to do complex code reasoning as well as rewriting of large codebases. We also present a novel framework for whole-program transformations that leverages lightweight static analysis to break the transformation into smaller steps that can be carried out effectively by an LLM. We implement our ideas in a tool called MSA that targets the CheckedC dialect. We evaluate MSA on several micro-benchmarks, as well as real-world code ranging up to 20K lines of code. We showcase superior performance compared to a vanilla LLM baseline, as well as demonstrate improvement over a state-of-the-art symbolic (non-LLM) technique.",

        "Abstract": "With the increasing popularity of smart homes, more and more devices need to connect to home networks. Traditional home networks mainly rely on centralized networking, where an excessive number of devices in the centralized topology can increase the pressure on the central router, potentially leading to decreased network performance metrics such as communication latency. To address the latency performance issues brought about by centralized networks, this paper proposes a new network system called DHNet, and designs an algorithm for clustering networking and communication based on vector routing. Communication within clusters in a simulated virtual environment achieves a latency of approximately 0.7 milliseconds. Furthermore, by directly using the first non-\"lo\" network card address of a device as the protocol's network layer address, the protocol avoids the several tens of milliseconds of access latency caused by DHCP. The integration of service discovery functionality into the network layer protocol is achieved through a combination of \"server-initiated service push\" and \"client request + server reply\" methods. Compared to traditional application-layer DNS passive service discovery, the average latency is reduced by over 50%. The PVH protocol is implemented in the user space using the Go programming language, with implementation details drawn from Google's gVisor project. The code has been ported from x86\\_64 Linux computers to devices such as OpenWrt routers and Android smartphones. The PVH protocol can communicate through \"tunnels\" to provide IP compatibility, allowing existing applications based on TCP/IP to communicate using the PVH protocol without requiring modifications to their code.",

        "Abstract": "LLMs have become the go-to choice for code generation tasks, with an exponential increase in the training, development, and usage of LLMs specifically for code generation. To evaluate the ability of LLMs on code, both academic and industry practitioners rely on popular handcrafted benchmarks. However, prior benchmarks contain only a very limited set of problems, both in quantity and variety. Further, due to popularity and age, many benchmarks are prone to data leakage where example solutions can be readily found on the web and thus potentially in training data. Such limitations inevitably lead us to inquire: Is the leaderboard performance on existing benchmarks reliable and comprehensive enough to measure the program synthesis ability of LLMs? To address this, we introduce EvoEval -- a program synthesis benchmark suite created by evolving existing benchmarks into different targeted domains for a comprehensive evaluation of LLM coding abilities. Our study on 51 LLMs shows that compared to the high performance obtained on standard benchmarks like HumanEval, there is a significant drop in performance (on average 39.4%) when using EvoEval. Additionally, the decrease in performance can range from 19.6% to 47.7%, leading to drastic ranking changes amongst LLMs and showing potential overfitting of existing benchmarks. Furthermore, we showcase various insights, including the brittleness of instruction-following models when encountering rewording or subtle changes as well as the importance of learning problem composition and decomposition. EvoEval not only provides comprehensive benchmarks, but can be used to further evolve arbitrary problems to keep up with advances and the ever-changing landscape of LLMs for code. We have open-sourced our benchmarks, tools, and complete LLM generations at https://github.com/evo-eval/evoeval",

        "Abstract": "In the upcoming 6G era, vehicular networks are shifting from simple Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to the more complex Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity. At the forefront of this shift is the incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into vehicles. Known for their sophisticated natural language processing abilities, LLMs change how users interact with their vehicles. This integration facilitates voice-driven commands and interactions, departing from the conventional manual control systems. However, integrating LLMs into vehicular systems presents notable challenges. The substantial computational demands and energy requirements of LLMs pose significant challenges, especially in the constrained environment of a vehicle. Additionally, the time-sensitive nature of tasks in vehicular networks adds another layer of complexity. In this paper, we consider an edge computing system where vehicles process the initial layers of LLM computations locally, and offload the remaining LLM computation tasks to the Roadside Units (RSUs), envisioning a vehicular ecosystem where LLM computations seamlessly interact with the ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth capabilities of 6G networks. To balance the trade-off between completion time and energy consumption, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the vehicles and RSUs. The problem is then decomposed into two sub-problems, which are solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method and fractional programming technique. The simulation results clearly indicate that the algorithm we have proposed is highly effective in reducing both the completion time and energy consumption of the system.",

        "Abstract": "The uninterpretability of DNNs hinders their deployment to safety-critical applications. Recent works have shown that Abstract-Interpretation-based formal certification techniques provide promising avenues for building trust in DNNs to some extent. The intricate mathematical background of Abstract Interpretation poses two challenges: (i) easily designing the algorithms that capture the intricate DNN behavior by balancing cost vs. precision tradeoff, and (ii) maintaining the over-approximation-based soundness of these certifiers.\n  General-purpose programming languages like C++ provide extensive functionality, however, verifying the soundness of the algorithms written in them can be impractical. The most commonly used DNN certification libraries like auto_LiRPA and ERAN prove the correctness of their analyses. However, they consist of only a few hard-coded abstract domains and abstract transformers (or transfer functions) and do not allow the user to define new analyses. Further, these libraries can handle only specific DNN architectures.\n  To address these issues, we develop a declarative DSL -- ConstraintFlow -- that can be used to specify Abstract Interpretation-based DNN certifiers. In ConstraintFlow, programmers can easily define various existing and new abstract domains and transformers, all within just a few 10s of Lines of Code as opposed to 1000s of LOCs of existing libraries. We also provide lightweight automatic verification, which can be used to ensure the over-approximation-based soundness of the certifier code written in ConstraintFlow for arbitrary (but bounded) DNN architectures. Using this automated verification procedure, for the first time, we can verify the soundness of state-of-the-art DNN certifiers for arbitrary DNN architectures, all within a few minutes. We prove the soundness of our verification procedure and the completeness of a subset of ConstraintFlow.",

With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and their applications to code translation, there is an increasing need for comprehensive evaluation of these models. In this study, we empirically analyze the generated outputs of eleven popular instruct-tuned LLMs with parameters ranging from 1B up to 46.7B on 3,820 translation pairs across five languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our analysis found that between 26.4% and 73.7% of code translations produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing, as these translations often include a mix of code, quotes, and text rather than being purely source code. Overlooking the output format of these models can inadvertently lead to underestimation of their actual performance. This is particularly evident when evaluating them with execution-based metrics such as Computational Accuracy (CA). Our results demonstrate that a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expression can effectively extract the source code from the model generation output. In particular, our method can help eleven selected models achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%. Our findings shed light on and motivate future research to conduct more reliable benchmarks of LLMs for code translation.",

To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to \"take the wheel\": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%.

The Regent solver is verified by applying it to the standard test cases for inviscid flows. Benchmark simulations are performed on coarse to very fine point distributions to assess the solver's performance. The computational efficiency of the Regent solver on an A100 GPU is compared with an equivalent meshfree solver written in CUDA-C. The codes are then profiled to investigate the differences in their performance.

This technique empowers the model to autonomously devise \"solution plans\" to tackle intricate programming challenges, thereby improving its performance in code generation. Nevertheless, smaller models have been struggling to keep up with LLMs in deducing these plans, adversely affecting their code generation capabilities. Given the considerable size and associated deployment costs, along with concerns about data security, many teams opt for deploying smaller models for code generation. Consequently, there arises a compelling need for transferring LLMs' code generation reasoning abilities to the smaller models. In this paper, we propose the CodePLAN framework, which aims to transfer LLMs' reasoning capabilities to smaller models through distillation. We adopt a multi-task learning approach, jointly undertaking code generation and solution plan generation tasks, to enhance the code generation capabilities of the smaller model. To ensure the superior quality of the solution plans, we advocate for the utilization of backward reasoning and plan sampling strategies. Our experiments show that in comparison to the conventional fine-tuning approach, our approach improves the smaller model's code generation performance (measured in pass@1 metric) by over 130% on the challenging APPS benchmark.",

Like the early stages of many scientific disciplines, it is marked by the discovery of new phenomena, ad-hoc design decisions, and the lack of a uniform and compositional mathematical foundation. From the intricacies of the implementation of backpropagation, through a growing zoo of neural network architectures, to the new and poorly understood phenomena such as double descent, scaling laws or in-context learning, there are few unifying principles in deep learning. This thesis develops a novel mathematical foundation for deep learning based on the language of category theory. We develop a new framework that is a) end-to-end, b) unform, and c) not merely descriptive, but prescriptive, meaning it is amenable to direct implementation in programming languages with sufficient features. We also systematise many existing approaches, placing many existing constructions and concepts from the literature under the same umbrella. In Part I we identify and model two main properties of deep learning systems parametricity and bidirectionality by we expand on the previously defined construction of actegories and Para to study the former, and define weighted optics to study the latter. Combining them yields parametric weighted optics, a categorical model of artificial neural networks, and more. Part II justifies the abstractions from Part I, applying them to model backpropagation, architectures, and supervised learning. We provide a lens-theoretic axiomatisation of differentiation, covering not just smooth spaces, but discrete settings of boolean circuits as well. We survey existing, and develop new categorical models of neural network architectures. We formalise the notion of optimisers and lastly, combine all the existing concepts together, providing a uniform and compositional framework for supervised learning.",

        "Abstract": "In our times, when the world is increasingly becoming more dependent on software programs, writing bug-free, correct programs is crucial. Program verification based on formal methods can guarantee this by detecting run-time errors in safety-critical systems to avoid possible adverse impacts on human life and save time and money.\n  This project work tries to leverage Abstract Interpretation techniques for static analysis of C programs. C Analyzer is a tool developed for static analysis of C programs. This implementation of C Analyzer provides a plug-and-play domain architecture for multiple abstract domains to be used. C Analyzer supports four abstract domains - Interval, Octagon, Polyhedra, and Bit Vector. We use these different domains for required precision in program verification. C Analyzer tool uses LLVM C/C++ compiler frontend Clang API to generate and traverse the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of a given C program. This tool generates invariants in different abstract domains for statements in basic blocks of CFG during CFG traversal. Using these invariants, some properties of a program, such as dividing by zero, modulus zero, arithmetic overflow, etc., can be analyzed. We also use a source-to-source transformation tool, CIL (Common Intermediate language), to transform some C constructs into simpler constructs, such as transforming logical operators, switch statements, and conditional operators into if-else ladders and transforming do-while and for loops into while loops.\n  Using C Analyzer, C program constructs such as declarations, assignments, binary operations (arithmetic, relational, bitwise shift, etc.), conditions (if-else), loops (while, do while, for loop), nested conditions, and nested loops can be analyzed. Currently, this tool does not support arrays, structures, unions, pointers, or function calls.",

Our study introduces \"Guided Evolution\" (GE), a novel framework that diverges from these methods by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly modify code. GE leverages LLMs for a more intelligent, supervised evolutionary process, guiding mutations and crossovers. Our unique \"Evolution of Thought\" (EoT) technique further enhances GE by enabling LLMs to reflect on and learn from the outcomes of previous mutations. This results in a self-sustaining feedback loop that augments decision-making in model evolution. GE maintains genetic diversity, crucial for evolutionary algorithms, by leveraging LLMs' capability to generate diverse responses from expertly crafted prompts and modulate model temperature. This not only accelerates the evolution process but also injects expert like creativity and insight into the process. Our application of GE in evolving the ExquisiteNetV2 model demonstrates its efficacy: the LLM-driven GE autonomously produced variants with improved accuracy, increasing from 92.52% to 93.34%, without compromising model compactness. This underscores the potential of LLMs to accelerate the traditional model design pipeline, enabling models to autonomously evolve and enhance their own designs.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated their potential for automated generation of hardware description language (HDL) code from high-level prompts. Researchers have utilized fine-tuning to enhance the ability of these large language models (LLMs) in the field of Chip Design. However, the lack of Verilog data hinders further improvement in the quality of Verilog generation by LLMs. Additionally, the absence of a Verilog and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) script data augmentation framework significantly increases the time required to prepare the training dataset for LLM trainers. This paper proposes an automated design-data augmentation framework, which generates high-volume and high-quality natural language aligned with Verilog and EDA scripts. For Verilog generation, it translates Verilog files to an abstract syntax tree and then maps nodes to natural language with a predefined template. For Verilog repair, it uses predefined rules to generate the wrong verilog file and then pairs EDA Tool feedback with the right and wrong verilog file. For EDA Script generation, it uses existing LLM(GPT-3.5) to obtain the description of the Script. To evaluate the effectiveness of our data augmentation method, we finetune Llama2-13B and Llama2-7B models using the dataset generated by our augmentation framework. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the Verilog generation tasks with LLMs. Moreover, the accuracy of Verilog generation surpasses that of the current state-of-the-art open-source Verilog generation model, increasing from 58.8% to 70.6% with the same benchmark. Our 13B model (ChipGPT-FT) has a pass rate improvement compared with GPT-3.5 in Verilog generation and outperforms in EDA script (i.e., SiliconCompiler) generation with only 200 EDA script data.",

The bunch-by-bunch feedback is also included so that the user can simulate the damping of the unstable motion when its growth rate is faster than the radiation damping rate. The particle dynamics is based on the one-turn map, including the nonlinear effects of amplitude-dependent tune shift, high-order chromaticity, and second-order momentum compaction factor. A skew quadrupole can also be introduced by the users, which is very useful for the emittance sharing and the emittance exchange studies.

We take a first glance at how pre-trained LLMs perform in test program generation to optimize non-functional properties of the DUT. Therefore, we write a prompt to generate C code snippets that maximize the instructions per cycle of a super-scalar, out-of-order architecture in simulation.

They can generate code in different programming languages based on provided prompts, fulfilling a long-lasting dream in Software Engineering (SE), i.e., automatic code generation. Similar to human-written code, LLM-generated code is prone to bugs, and these bugs have not yet been thoroughly examined by the community. Given the increasing adoption of LLM-based code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) in SE activities, it is critical to understand the characteristics of bugs contained in code generated by LLMs. This paper examines a sample of 333 bugs collected from code generated using three leading LLMs (i.e., CodeGen, PanGu-Coder, and Codex) and identifies the following 10 distinctive bug patterns: Misinterpretations, Syntax Error, Silly Mistake, Prompt-biased code, Missing Corner Case, Wrong Input Type, Hallucinated Object, Wrong Attribute, Incomplete Generation, and Non-Prompted Consideration. The bug patterns are presented in the form of a taxonomy. The identified bug patterns are validated using an online survey with 34 LLM practitioners and researchers. The surveyed participants generally asserted the significance and prevalence of the bug patterns. Researchers and practitioners can leverage these findings to develop effective quality assurance techniques for LLM-generated code. This study sheds light on the distinctive characteristics of LLM-generated code.",

With JAXbind we drastically reduce the effort required to bind custom functions implemented in other programming languages with full support for Jacobian-vector products and vector-Jacobian products to JAX. Specifically, JAXbind provides an easy-to-use Python interface for defining custom, so-called JAX primitives. Via JAXbind, any function callable from Python can be exposed as a JAX primitive. JAXbind allows a user to interface the JAX function transformation engine with custom derivatives and batching rules, enabling all JAX transformations for the custom primitive.",

DevBench features a wide range of programming languages and domains, high-quality data collection, and carefully designed and verified metrics for each task.

Rather than embed authorization logic in an application's code, developers can write that logic as Cedar policies and delegate access decisions to Cedar's evaluation engine. Cedar's simple and intuitive syntax supports common authorization use-cases with readable policies, naturally leveraging concepts from role-based, attribute-based, and relation-based access control models. Cedar's policy structure enables access requests to be decided quickly. Cedar's policy validator leverages optional typing to help policy writers avoid mistakes, but not get in their way. Cedar's design has been finely balanced to allow for a sound and complete logical encoding, which enables precise policy analysis, e.g., to ensure that when refactoring a set of policies, the authorized permissions do not change. We have modeled Cedar in the Lean programming language, and used Lean's proof assistant to prove important properties of Cedar's design. We have implemented Cedar in Rust, and released it open-source. Comparing Cedar to two open-source languages, OpenFGA and Rego, we find (subjectively) that Cedar has equally or more readable policies, but (objectively) performs far better.",

Therefore, we propose an approach that empowers Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate a function called \"score\\_nodes\" which can further be used to identify crucial nodes based on their assigned scores. Our model consists of three main components: Manual Initialization, Population Management, and LLMs-based Evolution. It evolves from initial populations with a set of designed node scoring functions created manually. LLMs leverage their strong contextual understanding and rich programming skills to perform crossover and mutation operations on the individuals, generating excellent new functions. These functions are then categorized, ranked, and eliminated to ensure the stable development of the populations while preserving diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of our method, showcasing its strong generalization ability compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. It can consistently and orderly generate diverse and efficient node scoring functions.

        "Abstract": "When drafting question posts for Stack Overflow, developers may not accurately summarize the core problems in the question titles, which can cause these questions to not get timely help. Therefore, improving the quality of question titles has attracted the wide attention of researchers. An initial study aimed to automatically generate the titles by only analyzing the code snippets in the question body. However, this study ignored the helpful information in their corresponding problem descriptions. Therefore, we propose an approach SOTitle+ by considering bi-modal information (i.e., the code snippets and the problem descriptions) in the question body. Then we formalize the title generation for different programming languages as separate but related tasks and utilize multi-task learning to solve these tasks. Later we fine-tune the pre-trained language model CodeT5 to automatically generate the titles. Unfortunately, the inconsistent inputs and optimization objectives between the pre-training task and our investigated task may make fine-tuning hard to fully explore the knowledge of the pre-trained model. To solve this issue, SOTitle+ further prompt-tunes CodeT5 with hybrid prompts (i.e., mixture of hard and soft prompts). To verify the effectiveness of SOTitle+, we construct a large-scale high-quality corpus from recent data dumps shared by Stack Overflow. Our corpus includes 179,119 high-quality question posts for six popular programming languages. Experimental results show that SOTitle+ can significantly outperform four state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Our work indicates that considering bi-modal information and prompt learning in Stack Overflow title generation is a promising exploration direction.",

        "Abstract": "C-based interpreters such as CPython make extensive use of C \"extension\" code, which is opaque to static analysis tools and faster runtimes with JIT compilers, such as PyPy. Not only are the extensions opaque, but the interface between the dynamic language types and the C types can introduce impedance. We hypothesise that frequent calls to C extension code introduce significant overhead that is often unnecessary. We validate this hypothesis by introducing a simple technique, \"typed methods\", which allow selected C extension functions to have additional metadata attached to them in a backward-compatible way. This additional metadata makes it much easier for a JIT compiler (and as we show, even an interpreter!) to significantly reduce the call and return overhead. Although we have prototyped typed methods in PyPy, we suspect that the same technique is applicable to a wider variety of language runtimes and that the information can also be consumed by static analysis tooling.",

        "Abstract": "Context:  In the first part of his 2012 presentation \"Inventing on Principle\", Bret Victor gives a demo of a live code editor for Javascript which shows the dynamic history of values of variables in real time. This form of live programming has become known as \"probes\". Probes provide the programmer with permanent and continuous insight into the dynamic evolution of function or method variables, thus improving feedback and developer experience.\n  Inquiry: Although Victor shows a working prototype of live probes in the context of Javascript, he does not discuss strategies for implementing them. Later work provides an implementation approach, but this requires a programming language to be implemented on top of the GraalVM runtime. In this paper we present **LiveRec**, a generic approach for implementing probes which can be applied in the context of many programming languages, without requiring the modification of compilers or run-time systems.\n  Approach:  **LiveRec** is based on reusing existing debug protocols to implement probes. Methods or functions are compiled after every code change and executed inside the debugger. During execution the evolution of all local variables in the current stack frame are recorded and communicated back to the editor or IDE for display to the user.\n  Knowledge:  It turns out that mainstream debug protocols are rich enough for implementing live probes. Step-wise execution, code hot swapping, and stack frame inspection provide the right granularity and sufficient information to realize live probes, without modifying compilers or language runtimes. Furthermore, it turns out that the recently proposed Debugger Adapter Protocol (DAP) provides an even more generic approach of implementing live probes, but, in some cases, at the cost of a significant performance penalty.\n  Grounding:  We have applied **LiveRec** to implement probes using stack recording natively for Java through the Java Debug Interface (JDI), and through the DAP for Java, Python, C, and Javascript, all requiring just modest amounts of configuration code. We evaluate the run-time performance of all four probes prototypes, decomposed into: compile-after-change, hot swap, single step overhead, and stack recording overhead. Our initial results show that live probes on top of native debug APIs can be performant enough for interactive use. In the case of DAP, however, it highly depends on characteristics of the programming language implementation and its associated debugging infrastructure.\n  Importance: Live programming improves the programmer experience by providing immediate feedback about a program's execution and eliminating disruptive edit-compile-restart sequences. Probes are one way to shorten the programmer feedback loop at the level of functions and methods. Although probes are not new, and have been implemented in (prototype) systems, **LiveRec**'s approach of building live probes on top of existing and generic debug protocols promises a path towards probes for a host of mainstream programming languages, with reasonable effort.",

This mix puts both kinds of syntax on equal footing and, importantly, the enriched language does not disrupt a programmer's typical workflow.

The framework first uses genetic programming to find a set of symbolic loss functions. Second, the set of learned loss functions is subsequently parameterized and optimized via unrolled differentiation. The versatility and performance of the proposed framework are empirically validated on a diverse set of supervised learning tasks. Results show that the learned loss functions bring improved convergence, sample efficiency, and inference performance on tabulated, computer vision, and natural language processing problems, using a variety of task-specific neural network architectures.",

We present a critical reanalysis of these widely used models, detailing their assumptions and clarifying some steps in their derivation that were previously left unsaid. Our findings are implemented in the pAGN module for the Python programming language, which is the first public implementation of these accretion-disc models.

        "Abstract": "The BigCode project, an open-scientific collaboration focused on the responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs), introduces StarCoder2. In partnership with Software Heritage (SWH), we build The Stack v2 on top of the digital commons of their source code archive. Alongside the SWH repositories spanning 619 programming languages, we carefully select other high-quality data sources, such as GitHub pull requests, Kaggle notebooks, and code documentation. This results in a training set that is 4x larger than the first StarCoder dataset. We train StarCoder2 models with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters on 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens and thoroughly evaluate them on a comprehensive set of Code LLM benchmarks. We find that our small model, StarCoder2-3B, outperforms other Code LLMs of similar size on most benchmarks, and also outperforms StarCoderBase-15B. Our large model, StarCoder2- 15B, significantly outperforms other models of comparable size. In addition, it matches or outperforms CodeLlama-34B, a model more than twice its size. Although DeepSeekCoder- 33B is the best-performing model at code completion for high-resource languages, we find that StarCoder2-15B outperforms it on math and code reasoning benchmarks, as well as several low-resource languages. We make the model weights available under an OpenRAIL license and ensure full transparency regarding the training data by releasing the SoftWare Heritage persistent IDentifiers (SWHIDs) of the source code data.",

A programmer can automatically complete a code fragment after writing a few tokens, and the process of automatic completion is known as code completion. Several research studies on code completion have previously been conducted for method body completion and method parameter completion. However, this fundamental study explores the automatic completion of any program statement that might not even be part of a method.\n  The goal is to provide suggestions to the programmer for completing code throughout the codebase by identifying and analyzing code similarities. The proposed methodology can be regarded as a fundamental framework for automated code completion. From the investigation of hundreds of revisions of four subject systems written in C and Java, it is observed that the proposed method can automatically complete around 22% of code statements with an average accuracy of 87% that a programmer writes during development, accelerating software development time. The empirical analysis further demonstrates that the approach can be used with programming language neutrality.\n  The study concludes by illustrating that taking 10 characters as prefixes before invoking completion provides maximum precision.",

The real-time applications of this modality require both video rate image acquisition and fast data post-processing algorithms. First, one must check the physical realizability of the experimental Mueller matrices in order to filter out non-physical data, i.e. to test the positive semi-definiteness of the 4x4 Hermitian coherency matrix calculated from the elements of the corresponding Mueller matrix pixel-wise. For this purpose, we compared the execution time for the calculations of i) eigenvalues, ii) Cholesky decomposition, iii) Sylvester's criterion, and iv) coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the Hermitian coherency matrix using two different approaches, all calculated for the experimental Mueller matrix images (600 pixels x 700 pixels) of mouse uterine cervix. The calculations were performed using C++ and Julia programming languages. Our results showed the superiority of the algorithm iv), in particular, the version based on the simplification via Pauli matrices, in terms of execution time for our dataset, over other algorithms. The sequential implementation of the latter algorithm on a single core already satisfies the requirements of real-time polarimetric imaging in various domains. This can be further amplified by the proposed parallelization (for example, we achieve a 5-fold speed up on 6 cores).",

We demonstrate how stackless coroutines (a new feature in C++20) can enable fully-portable continuation stealing and present libfork a lock-free fine-grained parallelism library, combining coroutines with user-space, geometric segmented-stacks. We show our approach is able to achieve optimal time/memory scaling, both theoretically and empirically, across a variety of benchmarks. Compared to openMP (libomp), libfork is on average 7.2x faster and consumes 10x less memory. Similarly, compared to Intel's TBB, libfork is on average 2.7x faster and consumes 6.2x less memory.

In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts.

Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses.

However, the complexities in coordinating agents' cooperation and LLMs' erratic performance pose notable challenges in developing robust and efficient multi-agent applications. To tackle these challenges, we propose AgentScope, a developer-centric multi-agent platform with message exchange as its core communication mechanism.

At the same time, it is also armed with system-level support for managing and utilizing multi-modal data, tools, and external knowledge. Additionally, we design an actor-based distribution framework, enabling easy conversion between local and distributed deployments and automatic parallel optimization without extra effort. With these features, AgentScope empowers developers to build applications that fully realize the potential of intelligent agents.

It is a crucial aspect of scientific research, where it is needed to ensure the reproducibility and validity of experimental results. Similarly, in customer software testing, it is difficult for customers to verify that their specific program version was tested or executed at all. Existing state-of-the-art solutions, such as hardware-based approaches, constraint solvers, and verifiable computation systems, do not provide definitive proof of execution, which hinders reliable testing and analysis of program results. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that combines a prototype programming language called Mona with a certification protocol OCCP to enable the distributed and decentralized re-execution of program segments. Our protocol allows for certification of program segments in a distributed, immutable, and trustworthy system without the need for naive re-execution, resulting in significant improvements in terms of time and computational resources used. We also explore the use of blockchain technology to manage the protocol workflow following other approaches in this space. Our approach offers a promising solution to the challenges of program execution verification and opens up opportunities for further research and development in this area. Our findings demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in reducing the number of program executions compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, thus improving the efficiency of certifying program executions.",

We study the formation of dependency networks among software packages and libraries, guided by a structural model of network formation with observable and unobservable heterogeneity. We estimate costs, benefits, and link externalities of the network of 696,790 directed dependencies between 35,473 repositories of the Rust programming language using a novel scalable algorithm. We find evidence of a positive externality exerted on other coders when coders create dependencies. Furthermore, we show that coders are likely to link to more popular packages of the same software type but less popular packages of other types. We adopt models for the spread of infectious diseases to measure a package's systemicness as the number of downstream packages a vulnerability would affect. Systemicness is highly skewed with the most systemic repository affecting almost 90% of all repositories only two steps away. Lastly, we show that protecting only the ten most important repositories reduces vulnerability contagion by nearly 40%.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and have become capable of solving a plethora of tasks through proper instructions in natural language. However, the vast majority of testing suites assume that the instructions are written in English, the de facto prompting language. Code intelligence and problem solving still remain a difficult task, even for the most advanced LLMs. Currently, there are no datasets to measure the generalization power for code-generation models in a language other than English. In this work, we present RoCode, a competitive programming dataset, consisting of 2,642 problems written in Romanian, 11k solutions in C, C++ and Python and comprehensive testing suites for each problem. The purpose of RoCode is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the code intelligence of language models trained on Romanian / multilingual text as well as a fine-tuning set for pretrained Romanian models. Through our results and review of related works, we argue for the need to develop code models for languages other than English.",

        "Abstract": "Datalog is a popular and widely-used declarative logic programming language. Datalog engines apply many cross-rule optimizations; bugs in them can cause incorrect results. To detect such optimization bugs, we propose an automated testing approach called Incremental Rule Evaluation (IRE), which synergistically tackles the test oracle and test case generation problem. The core idea behind the test oracle is to compare the results of an optimized program and a program without cross-rule optimization; any difference indicates a bug in the Datalog engine. Our core insight is that, for an optimized, incrementally-generated Datalog program, we can evaluate all rules individually by constructing a reference program to disable the optimizations that are performed among multiple rules. Incrementally generating test cases not only allows us to apply the test oracle for every new rule generated-we also can ensure that every newly added rule generates a non-empty result with a given probability and eschew recomputing already-known facts. We implemented IRE as a tool named Deopt, and evaluated Deopt on four mature Datalog engines, namely Soufflé, CozoDB, $μ$Z, and DDlog, and discovered a total of 30 bugs. Of these, 13 were logic bugs, while the remaining were crash and error bugs. Deopt can detect all bugs found by queryFuzz, a state-of-the-art approach. Out of the bugs identified by Deopt, queryFuzz might be unable to detect 5. Our incremental test case generation approach is efficient; for example, for test cases containing 60 rules, our incremental approach can produce 1.17$\\times$ (for DDlog) to 31.02$\\times$ (for Soufflé) as many valid test cases with non-empty results as the naive random method. We believe that the simplicity and the generality of the approach will lead to its wide adoption in practice.",

While widely explored in natural language applications, its utilization in code generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce Active Retrieval in Knowledge Soup (ARKS), an advanced strategy for generalizing large language models for code. In contrast to relying on a single source, we construct a knowledge soup integrating web search, documentation, execution feedback, and evolved code snippets. We employ an active retrieval strategy that iteratively refines the query and updates the knowledge soup. To assess the performance of ARKS, we compile a new benchmark comprising realistic coding problems associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages. Experimental results on ChatGPT and CodeLlama demonstrate a substantial improvement in the average execution accuracy of ARKS on LLMs. The analysis confirms the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge soup and active retrieval strategies, offering rich insights into the construction of effective retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) pipelines.

These users are often interested in data-centric tasks, such as spreadsheet manipulation and data wrangling, which are hard to solve if the intent is only communicated using a natural-language description, without including the data. But how do we decide how much data and which data to include in the prompt? This paper makes two contributions towards answering this question. First, we create a dataset of real-world NL-to-code tasks manipulating tabular data, mined from StackOverflow posts. Second, we introduce a cluster-then-select prompting technique, which adds the most representative rows from the input data to the LLM prompt. Our experiments show that LLM performance is indeed sensitive to the amount of data passed in the prompt, and that for tasks with a lot of syntactic variation in the input table, our cluster-then-select technique outperforms a random selection baseline.",

As an alternative, we introduce CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs. CodeMind currently supports three code reasoning tasks: Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Dependent Execution Reasoning (DER), and Specification Reasoning (SR). The first two evaluate models to predict the execution output of an arbitrary code or code the model could correctly synthesize. The third one evaluates the extent to which LLMs implement the specified expected behavior.\n  Our extensive evaluation of nine LLMs across five benchmarks in two different programming languages using CodeMind shows that LLMs fairly follow control flow constructs and, in general, explain how inputs evolve to output, specifically for simple programs and the ones they can correctly synthesize. However, their performance drops for code with higher complexity, non-trivial logical and arithmetic operators, non-primitive types, and API calls. Furthermore, we observe that, while correlated, specification reasoning (essential for code synthesis) does not imply execution reasoning (essential for broader programming tasks such as testing and debugging): ranking LLMs based on test passing can be different compared to code reasoning.",

This paper explores the integration of static analysis and additional context such as bug reports and design patterns into source code representations for deep learning models. We use the Abstract Syntax Tree-based Neural Network (ASTNN) method and augment it with additional context information obtained from bug reports and design patterns, creating an enriched source code representation that significantly enhances the performance of common software engineering tasks such as code classification and code clone detection.

        "Abstract": "The imperative need to scale computation across numerous nodes highlights the significance of efficient parallel computing, particularly in the realm of Message Passing Interface (MPI) integration. The challenging parallel programming task of generating MPI-based parallel programs has remained unexplored. This study first investigates the performance of state-of-the-art language models in generating MPI-based parallel programs. Findings reveal that widely used models such as GPT-3.5 and PolyCoder (specialized multi-lingual code models) exhibit notable performance degradation, when generating MPI-based programs compared to general-purpose programs. In contrast, domain-specific models such as MonoCoder, which are pretrained on MPI-related programming languages of C and C++, outperform larger models. Subsequently, we introduce a dedicated downstream task of MPI-based program generation by fine-tuning MonoCoder on HPCorpusMPI. We call the resulting model as MPIrigen. We propose an innovative preprocessing for completion only after observing the whole code, thus enabling better completion with a wider context. Comparative analysis against GPT-3.5 zero-shot performance, using a novel HPC-oriented evaluation method, demonstrates that MPIrigen excels in generating accurate MPI functions up to 0.8 accuracy in location and function predictions, and with more than 0.9 accuracy for argument predictions. The success of this tailored solution underscores the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning in optimizing language models for parallel computing code generation, paving the way for a new generation of automatic parallelization tools.

By utilizing a single VADL processor specification, the VADL system exhibits the capability to automatically generate a range of artifacts necessary for rapid design space exploration. These include assemblers, compilers, linkers, functional instruction set simulators, cycle-accurate instruction set simulators, synthesizable specifications in a hardware description language, as well as test cases and documentation. One distinctive feature of VADL lies in its separation of the instruction set architecture (ISA) specification and the microarchitecture (MiA) specification. This segregation allows users the flexibility to combine various ISAs with different MiAs, providing a versatile approach to processor design. In contrast to existing PDLs, VADL's MiA specification operates at a higher level of abstraction, enhancing the clarity and simplicity of the design process. Notably, with a single ISA specification, VADL streamlines compiler generation and maintenance by eliminating the need for intricate compiler-specific knowledge. This article introduces VADL, describes the generator techniques in detail and demonstrates the power of the language and the performance of the generators in an empirical evaluation. The evaluation shows the expressiveness and conciseness of VADL and the efficiency of the generated artifacts.",

        "Abstract": "On-the-fly syntax highlighting is the task of rapidly associating visual secondary notation values with each character of a language derivation. Research in this domain is driven by the prevalence of online software development tools, which frequently display source code on screen and heavily rely on syntax highlighting mechanisms. In this context, three contrasting demands confront resolvers in this space: speed, accuracy, and development costs. Speed constraints are essential to ensure tool usability, manifesting as responsiveness for end users accessing online source code and minimising system overhead. Simultaneously, achieving precise highlighting is critical for enhancing code comprehensibility. Nevertheless, obtaining accurate results necessitates the capacity to perform grammatical analysis on the code under consideration, even in cases of varying grammatical correctness. Furthermore, addressing the development costs of such resolvers is imperative, given the multitude of programming language versions. The current state-of-the-art approach in this field leverages the original lexer and parser of programming languages to create syntax highlighting oracles, subsequently used for training base Recurrent Neural Network models. As the question of the generalisation of such a solution persists, this paper addresses this aspect by extending the original work to three additional mainstream programming languages and conducting a comprehensive review of the outcomes. Moreover, the original limitations in evaluation performance and training costs are mitigated through the introduction of a novel Convolutional based Neural Network model. This study examines the performance gains of running models on GPUs, finding that the new CNN implementation is much faster than previous methods while maintaining high accuracy.",

In this paper, we present VerMCTS, an approach to begin to resolve this issue by generating verified programs in Dafny and Coq. VerMCTS uses a logical verifier in concert with an LLM to guide a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach leverages the verifier to gain intermediate feedback inside the search algorithm by checking partial programs at each step to estimate an upper bound on the value function. To measure the performance of VerMCTS, we develop a new suite of multi-step verified programming problems in Dafny and Coq. In terms of pass@T, a new metric which computes the pass rate given a budget of T tokens sampled from the LLM, VerMCTS leads to more than a 30% absolute increase in average pass@5000 across the suite over repeated sampling from the base language model.

On one hand, LLMs excel at natural language processing but do not perform well on planning.

We leverage the strengths of both the techniques by using an LLM for generating the PDDL representation (task PDDL) of planning task requests followed by using a classical planner for computing a plan. Unlike previous approaches that use LLMs for generating task PDDLs directly, our approach comprises of (a) translate: using an LLM only for generating a logically interpretable intermediate representation of natural language task description, (b) infer: deriving additional logically dependent information from the intermediate representation using a logic reasoner (currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and (c) compile: generating the target task PDDL from the base and inferred information. We observe that using an LLM to only output the intermediate representation significantly reduces LLM errors. Consequently, TIC approach achieves, for at least one LLM, high accuracy on task PDDL generation for all seven domains of our evaluation dataset.",

Then we thoroughly investigate state-of-the-art probabilistic methods applied to CodeLlama using these shifted code snippets. We observe that these methods generally improve the uncertainty awareness of CodeLlama, with increased calibration quality and higher uncertainty estimation~(UE) precision.

LLM inference is commonly performed on batches of sequences that share a prefix, such as few-shot examples or a chatbot system prompt. Decoding in this large-batch setting can be bottlenecked by the attention operation, which reads large key-value (KV) caches from memory and computes inefficient matrix-vector products for every sequence in the batch. In this work, we introduce Hydragen, a hardware-aware exact implementation of attention with shared prefixes. Hydragen computes attention over the shared prefix and unique suffixes separately. This decomposition enables efficient prefix attention by batching queries together across sequences, reducing redundant memory reads and enabling the use of hardware-friendly matrix multiplications. Our method can improve end-to-end CodeLlama-13b throughput by up to 32x against competitive baselines, with speedup growing with the batch size and shared prefix length. Hydragen also enables the use of very long shared contexts: with a large batch size, increasing the prefix length from 1K to 16K tokens decreases Hydragen throughput by less than 15%, while the throughput of baselines drops by over 90%. Hydragen generalizes beyond simple prefix-suffix decomposition and can be applied to tree-based prompt sharing patterns, allowing us to further reduce inference time on competitive programming problems by 55%.",

Thus, optimal prompt construction is essential for maximizing the utility and performance of ChatGPT.

Existing studies explore several prompt patterns and strategies to improve the relevance of responses generated by ChatGPT. However, the exploration of constraints that necessitate the submission of multiple prompts is still an unmet attempt. In this study, our contributions are twofold. First, we attempt to uncover gaps in prompt design that demand multiple iterations. In particular, we manually analyze 686 prompts that were submitted to resolve issues related to Java and Python programming languages and identify eleven prompt design gaps (e.g., missing specifications). Such gap exploration can enhance the efficacy of single prompts in ChatGPT. Second, we attempt to reproduce the ChatGPT response by consolidating multiple prompts into a single one. We can completely consolidate prompts with four gaps (e.g., missing context) and partially consolidate prompts with three gaps (e.g., additional functionality). Such an effort provides concrete evidence to users to design more optimal prompts mitigating these gaps. Our study findings and evidence can - (a) save users time, (b) reduce costs, and (c) increase user satisfaction.",

While many solutions have been proposed, balancing security, run-time cost, and memory overhead (an impossible trinity) is hard.\n  In this paper, we show one way to balance the trinity by passing more semantics about the heap object to the allocator for it to make informed allocation decisions. More specifically, we propose a new notion of thread-, context-, and flow-sensitive \"type\", SemaType, to capture the semantics and prototype a SemaType-based allocator that aims for the best trade-off amongst the impossible trinity. In SeMalloc, only heap objects allocated from the same call site and via the same function call stack can possibly share a virtual memory address, which effectively stops type-confusion attacks and makes UAF vulnerabilities harder to exploit.\n  Through extensive empirical evaluation, we show that SeMalloc is realistic: (a) SeMalloc is effective in thwarting all real-world vulnerabilities we tested; (b) benchmark programs run even slightly faster with SeMalloc than the default heap allocator, at a memory overhead averaged from 41% to 84%; and (c) SeMalloc balances security and overhead strictly better than other closely related works.",

        "Abstract": "The usage of error handling in Solidity smart contracts is vital because smart contracts perform transactions that should be verified. Transactions that are not carefully handled, may lead to program crashes and vulnerabilities, implying financial loss and legal consequences. While Solidity designers attempt to constantly update the language with new features, including error-handling (EH) features, it is necessary for developers to promptly absorb how to use them. We conduct a large-scale empirical study on 283K unique open-source smart contracts to identify patterns regarding the usage of Solidity EH features over time. Overall, the usage of most EH features is limited. However, we observe an upward trend (> 60%) in the usage of a Solidity-tailored EH feature, i.e., require. This indicates that designers of modern programming languages may consider making error handling more tailored to the purposes of each language. Our analysis on 102 versions of the Solidity documentation indicates the volatile nature of Solidity, as the language changes frequently, i.e., there are changes on EH features once or twice a year. Such frequent releases may confuse smart contract developers, discouraging them to carefully read the Solidity documentation, and correctly adopt EH features. Furthermore, our findings reveal that nearly 70% of the examined smart contracts are exposed to potential failures due to missing error handing, e.g., unchecked external calls. Therefore, the use of EH features should be further supported via a more informative documentation containing (1) representative and meaningful examples and (2) details about the impact of potential EH misuses.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce Object Graph Programming (OGO), which enables reading and modifying an object graph (i.e., the entire state of the object heap) via declarative queries. OGO models the objects and their relations in the heap as an object graph thereby treating the heap as a graph database: each node in the graph is an object (e.g., an instance of a class or an instance of a metadata class) and each edge is a relation between objects (e.g., a field of one object references another object). We leverage Cypher, the most popular query language for graph databases, as OGO's query language. Unlike LINQ, which uses collections (e.g., List) as a source of data, OGO views the entire object graph as a single \"collection\". OGO is ideal for querying collections (just like LINQ), introspecting the runtime system state (e.g., finding all instances of a given class or accessing fields via reflection), and writing assertions that have access to the entire program state. We prototyped OGO for Java in two ways: (a) by translating an object graph into a Neo4j database on which we run Cypher queries, and (b) by implementing our own in-memory graph query engine that directly queries the object heap. We used OGO to rewrite hundreds of statements in large open-source projects into OGO queries. We report our experience and performance of our prototypes.",

The first step is the data collection from the internal discussion forum and YouTube comments of a Web Programming channel. The next step is text preprocessing to annotate the text and clear unimportant words. Furthermore, with the text dataset that has been successfully cleaned, sentiment analysis and epistemic categorization will be done in each sentence of the text. Sentiment analysis is divided into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Bloomś epistemic is divided into six categories: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating.

SymbolicAI enables the seamless integration of generative models with a diverse range of solvers by treating large language models (LLMs) as semantic parsers that execute tasks based on both natural and formal language instructions, thus bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and generative AI. We leverage probabilistic programming principles to tackle complex tasks, and utilize differentiable and classical programming paradigms with their respective strengths. The framework introduces a set of polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for multi-modal data that connects multi-step generative processes and aligns their outputs with user objectives in complex workflows. As a result, we can transition between the capabilities of various foundation models with in-context learning capabilities and specialized, fine-tuned models or solvers proficient in addressing specific problems. Through these operations based on in-context learning our framework enables the creation and evaluation of explainable computational graphs. Finally, we introduce a quality measure and its empirical score for evaluating these computational graphs, and propose a benchmark that compares various state-of-the-art LLMs across a set of complex workflows. We refer to the empirical score as the \"Vector Embedding for Relational Trajectory Evaluation through Cross-similarity\", or VERTEX score for short.

        "Abstract": "Large language models show great promise in many domains, including programming. A promise is easy to make but hard to keep, and language models often fail to keep their promises, generating erroneous code. A promising avenue to keep models honest is to incorporate formal verification: generating programs' specifications as well as code so that the code can be proved correct with respect to the specifications. Unfortunately, existing large language models show a severe lack of proficiency in verified programming.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate how to improve two pretrained models' proficiency in the Dafny verification-aware language. Using 178 problems from the MBPP dataset, we prompt two contemporary models (GPT-4 and PaLM-2) to synthesize Dafny methods. We use three different types of prompts: a direct Contextless prompt; a Signature prompt that includes a method signature and test cases, and a Chain of Thought (CoT) prompt that decomposes the problem into steps and includes retrieval augmentation generated example problems and solutions. Our results show that GPT-4 performs better than PaLM-2 on these tasks and that both models perform best with the retrieval augmentation generated CoT prompt. GPT-4 was able to generate verified, human-evaluated, Dafny methods for 58% of the problems, however, GPT-4 managed only 19% of the problems with the Contextless prompt, and even fewer (10%) for the Signature prompt. We are thus able to contribute 153 verified Dafny solutions to MBPP problems, 50 that we wrote manually, and 103 synthesized by GPT-4.\n  Our results demonstrate that the benefits of formal program verification are now within reach of code generating large language models...",

Additionally, the output of these tools often lacks interoperability and results in excessively large graphs, making graph-based neural networks training slower and less scalable.\n  We introduce CONCORD, a domain-specific language to build customizable graph representations. It implements reduction heuristics to reduce graphs' size complexity. We demonstrate its effectiveness in code smell detection as an illustrative use case and show that: first, CONCORD can produce code representations automatically per the specified configuration, and second, our heuristics can achieve comparable performance with significantly reduced size. CONCORD will help researchers a) create and experiment with customizable graph-based code representations for different software engineering tasks involving DL, b) reduce the engineering work to generate graph representations, c) address the issue of scalability in GNN models, and d) enhance the reproducibility of experiments in research through a standardized approach to code representation and analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Code completion aims to enhance programming productivity by predicting potential code based on the current programming context. Recently, pretrained language models (LMs) have become prominent in this field. Various approaches have been proposed to fine-tune LMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) techniques for code completion. However, the inherent exposure bias of these models can cause errors to accumulate early in the sequence completion, leading to even more errors in subsequent completions. To address this problem, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an alternative technique for fine-tuning LMs for code completion, which can improve the generalization capabilities and overall performance. Nevertheless, integrating DRL-based strategies into code completion faces two major challenges: 1) The dynamic nature of the code context requires the completion model to quickly adapt to changes, which poses difficulties for conventional DRL strategies that focus on delayed rewarding of the final code state. 2) It is difficult to evaluate the correctness of partial code, thus the reward redistribution-based strategies cannot be adapted to code completion. To tackle these challenges, we propose IRCoCo, a code completion-specific DRL-based fine-tuning framework. This framework is designed to provide immediate rewards as feedback for detecting dynamic context changes arising from continuous edits during code completion. With the aid of immediate feedback, the fine-tuned LM can gain a more precise understanding of the current context, thereby enabling effective adjustment of the LM and optimizing code completion in a more refined manner. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning pretrained LMs with IRCoCo leads to significant improvements in the code completion task, outperforming both SFT-based and other DRL-based baselines.",

One practical mitigation is compartmentalization, which allows developers to structure large programs into mutually distrustful compartments with clearly specified privileges and interactions. In this paper we introduce SECOMP, a compiler for compartmentalized C code that comes with machine-checked proofs guaranteeing that the scope of undefined behavior is restricted to the compartments that encounter it and become dynamically compromised. These guarantees are formalized as the preservation of safety properties against adversarial contexts, a secure compilation criterion similar to full abstraction, and this is the first time such a strong criterion is proven for a mainstream programming language. To achieve this we extend the languages of the CompCert verified C compiler with isolated compartments that can only interact via procedure calls and returns, as specified by cross-compartment interfaces. We adapt the passes and optimizations of CompCert as well as their correctness proofs to this compartment-aware setting. We then use compiler correctness as an ingredient in a larger secure compilation proof that involves several proof engineering novelties, needed to scale formally secure compilation up to a C compiler.",

        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on basic programming problems. However, they encounter challenges when dealing with complex tasks involving the use of diverse algorithmic and data structure skills, particularly programming competition-level problems. Notably, ChatGPT exhibits proficient performance on problems it has encountered during its pre-training phase, but this performance deteriorates when faced with novel problems. Consequently, enhancing the ability of LLMs to address unfamiliar problems has emerged as a pivotal research focus. The problem-solving process of LLMs mirrors human programmers' approach to a certain extent. When confronted with new programming tasks, human programmers engage in task planning and code writing with the previously acquired knowledge about algorithms and data structures. Despite having learned such knowledge, LLMs struggle to effectively apply it when faced with specific new problems. To address this issue, we constructed a novel dataset, CodeF, which contains a portion of programming problems that ChatGPT has not previously encountered. Furthermore, we developed a Knowledge Library tailored for Python programming contest problems and introduced the concept of Knowledge-Aware Code Generation (KareCoder). KareCoder bolsters the models' understanding and problem-solving capabilities by integrating prompt and knowledge from the library into the LLMs' code generation reasoning process, especially on Pass@1 metrics. Upon testing on the CodeF and APPS datasets, KareCoder demonstrated outstanding performance in handling novel problems previously unencountered by LLMs. In contrast with the code directly generated by ChatGPT, KareCoder achieved a relative improvement of 23.3% on the Pass@1 metric on the CodeF post2021-9 dataset. Additionally, it performs well compared to other methods when dealing with problems that LLMs have previously encountered.",

Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches. Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations. The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training. To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection. APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL. (2) Guided API Recommendation. APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs. With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results. We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks. Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1. Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.",

The existing methods for constructing such a problem set can be categorized into two main types: manual methods and perturbation-based methods. However, manual methods demand high effort and lack scalability, while also risking data integrity due to LCGMs' potentially contaminated data collection, and perturbation-based approaches mainly generate semantically homogeneous problems with the same canonical solutions and introduce typos that can be easily auto-corrected by IDE, making them ineffective and unrealistic.

Using compute accelerators, such as GPUs, is one of the promising ways to provide the necessary computational power to meet the challenge. The current programming models for compute accelerators often involve using architecture-specific programming languages promoted by the hardware vendors and hence limit the set of platforms that the code can run on. Developing software with platform restrictions is especially unfeasible for HEP communities as it takes significant effort to convert typical HEP algorithms into ones that are efficient for compute accelerators. Multiple performance portability solutions have recently emerged and provide an alternative path for using compute accelerators, which allow the code to be executed on hardware from different vendors. We apply several portability solutions, such as Kokkos, SYCL, C++17 std::execution::par and Alpaka, on two mini-apps extracted from the mkFit project: p2z and p2r. These apps include basic kernels for a Kalman filter track fit, such as propagation and update of track parameters, for detectors at a fixed z or fixed r position, respectively.

        "Abstract": "For combinatorial optimization problems, model-based paradigms such as mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) aim to decouple modeling and solving a problem: the `holy grail' of declarative problem solving. We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a new model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by AI planning. We show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven.",

        "Abstract": "This paper investigates the ability of transformer-based models to learn structural recursion from examples. Recursion is a universal concept in both natural and formal languages. Structural recursion is central to the programming language and formal mathematics tasks where symbolic tools currently excel beyond neural models, such as inferring semantic relations between datatypes and emulating program behavior. We introduce a general framework that nicely connects the abstract concepts of structural recursion in the programming language domain to concrete sequence modeling problems and learned models' behavior. The framework includes a representation that captures the general \\textit{syntax} of structural recursion, coupled with two different frameworks for understanding their \\textit{semantics} -- one that is more natural from a programming languages perspective and one that helps bridge that perspective with a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transformer architecture.\n  With our framework as a powerful conceptual tool, we identify different issues under various set-ups. The models trained to emulate recursive computations cannot fully capture the recursion yet instead fit short-cut algorithms and thus cannot solve certain edge cases that are under-represented in the training distribution. In addition, it is difficult for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to mine recursive rules from in-context demonstrations. Meanwhile, these LLMs fail in interesting ways when emulating reduction (step-wise computation) of the recursive function.",

We propose a general program, $\\texttt{Infer--Retrieve--Rank}$, that defines multi-step interactions between LMs and retrievers to efficiently tackle such problems. We implement this program using the $\\texttt{DSPy}$ programming model, which specifies in-context systems in a declarative manner, and use $\\texttt{DSPy}$ optimizers to tune it towards specific datasets by bootstrapping only tens of few-shot examples. Our primary extreme classification program, optimized separately for each task, attains state-of-the-art results across three benchmarks (HOUSE, TECH, TECHWOLF). We apply the same program to a benchmark with vastly different characteristics and attain competitive performance as well (BioDEX). Unlike prior work, our proposed solution requires no finetuning, is easily applicable to new tasks, alleviates prompt engineering, and requires only tens of labeled examples.

To address these issues, we collect a practical Text-to-SQL benchmark dataset and propose a model-agnostic Large Language Model (LLMs)-based Text-to-SQL framework for financial analysis. The benchmark dataset, BULL, is collected from the practical financial analysis business of Hundsun Technologies Inc., including databases for fund, stock, and macro economy. Besides, the proposed LLMs-based Text-to-SQL framework, FinSQL, provides a systematic treatment for financial Text-to-SQL from the perspectives of prompt construction, parameter-efficient fine-tuning and output calibration. Extensive experimental results on BULL demonstrate that FinSQL achieves the state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL performance at a small cost; furthermore, FinSQL can bring up to 36.64% performance improvement in scenarios requiring few-shot cross-database model transfer.",

Existing tools, however, resort to preprocessing the source file first, then porting the resulting code, leaving barely recognizable code that loses macro abstractions. To preserve macro usage, porting tools need analyses that understand macro behavior to port to equivalent constructs. But macro semantics differ from typical functions, precluding simple syntactic transformations to port them. We introduce the first comprehensive framework for analyzing the portability of macro usage. We decompose macro behavior into 26 fine-grained properties and implement a program analysis tool, called Maki, that identifies them in real-world code with 94% accuracy. We apply Maki to 21 programs containing a total of 86,199 macro definitions. We found that real-world macros are much more portable than previously known. More than a third (37%) are easy-to-port, and Maki provides hints for porting more complicated macros. We find, on average, 2x more easy-to-port macros and up to 7x more in the best case compared to prior work. Guided by Maki's output, we found and hand-ported macros in four real-world programs. We submitted patches to Linux maintainers that transform eleven macros, nine of which have been accepted.",

We introduce The Mikado Filesystem (mikfs), which provides an open simple lightweight interoperable portable extensible remote filesystem that is open source. mikfs consists of client applications accessing remote servers via RPC running over TCP/IP connections. mikfs is defined as a concrete set of API method calls over gRPC expressed in Google's Protocol Buffers' IDL. gRPC supports a wide variety of programming languages & platforms. For a given language + platform, the gRPC toolset can generate client- & server-side stubs from the IDL callable from client & server code in the selected languages, e.g., a client written in C# or java running on a Windows PC can access a server written in C++ running on Linux. mikfs consists of a virtual hierarchical tree of files & directories. This logical filesystem is not constrained to the limits and file naming conventions of the host's own physical native filesystem. API methods are provided for authentication; for atomic file-level operations on files & directories; for clients to register to receive notifications of file & directory changes on a server. The public API allows developers to write their own new servers and clients; allowing migration of hosted files between different implementations; extension with new methods & features; is Open Source code available for inspection and adaptation. gRPC provides secure authenticated connection & communication over HTTP/2; End-to-End Privacy & Security against eavesdropping of data in transit; support for multiple alternate user login mechanisms. mikfs is provided as source code, 'The Bootstrap Distribution', consisting of an ecosystem of clients, servers, tools and utilities.",

This work studies to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate coding and algorithmic tasks to provide insights into general capabilities in such algorithmic reasoning tasks. We introduce benchmarks for straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the simulation capabilities of LLMs with sorting algorithms and nested loops and show that a routine's computational complexity directly affects an LLM's ability to simulate its execution. While the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong simulation capabilities, the process is fragile, seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition, and is affected by memorisation. We propose a novel off-the-shelf prompting method, Chain of Simulation (CoSm), which instructs LLMs to simulate code execution line by line/follow the computation pattern of compilers. CoSm efficiently helps LLMs reduce memorisation and shallow pattern recognition while improving simulation performance. We consider the success of CoSm in code simulation to be inspirational for other general routine simulation reasoning tasks.",

        "Abstract": "Confidential computing is a security paradigm that enables the protection of confidential code and data in a co-tenanted cloud deployment using specialized hardware isolation units called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). By integrating TEEs with a Remote Attestation protocol, confidential computing allows a third party to establish the integrity of an \\textit{enclave} hosted within an untrusted cloud. However, TEE solutions, such as Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, offer low-level C/C++-based toolchains that are susceptible to inherent memory safety vulnerabilities and lack language constructs to monitor explicit and implicit information-flow leaks. Moreover, the toolchains involve complex multi-project hierarchies and the deployment of hand-written attestation protocols for verifying \\textit{enclave} integrity.\n  We address the above with HasTEE+, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Haskell that enables programming TEEs in a high-level language with strong type-safety. HasTEE+ assists in multi-tier cloud application development by (1) introducing a \\textit{tierless} programming model for expressing distributed client-server interactions as a single program, (2) integrating a general remote-attestation architecture that removes the necessity to write application-specific cross-cutting attestation code, and (3) employing a dynamic information flow control mechanism to prevent explicit as well as implicit data leaks. We demonstrate the practicality of HasTEE+ through a case study on confidential data analytics, presenting a data-sharing pattern applicable to mutually distrustful participants and providing overall performance metrics.",

Rust code is arguably known best for its speed and memory safety, a property essential while developing embedded systems. Thus, it becomes one of the alternatives when developing operating systems for embedded devices. How to convert an existing C++ code base to Rust is also gaining greater attention. In this work, we focus on the process of transpiling C++ code to a Rust codebase in a robust and safe manner. The manual transpilation process is carried out to understand the different constructs of the Rust language and how they correspond to C++ constructs. Based on the learning from the manual transpilation, a transpilation table is created to aid in future transpilation efforts and to develop an automated transpiler. We also studied the existing automated transpilers and identified the problems and inefficiencies they involved. The results of the transpilation process were closely monitored and evaluated, showing improved memory safety without compromising performance and reliability of the resulting codebase. The study concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the findings, an evaluation of the implications for future research, and recommendations for the same in this area.",

The positions of center of mass of the monomers were extracted and a series of spatial analysis were conducted to estimate the distribution of free volume or unoccupied space by Voronoi tessellation algorithm. An open-source software was employed which incorporates both compilers of Matlab and C programing languages to reduce the computational costs associated with Voronoi calculations and statistical analysis. The results confirmed that low free volume content is achievable through annealing while high free volume content is achievable through quenching samples at high cooling rates. An appreciable degree of short-range order in the packing of chains is revealed in annealed samples.",

However, systematic testing of compilers is infeasible, given the vast space of possible programs and the complexity of modern programming languages. In this context, differential testing offers a practical methodology as it addresses the oracle problem by comparing the output of alternative compilers given the same set of programs as input. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of differential testing in finding bugs within the Kotlin compilers developed at JetBrains. We propose a black-box generative approach that creates input programs for the K1 and K2 compilers. First, we build workable models of Kotlin semantic (semantic interface) and syntactic (enriched context-free grammar) language features, which are subsequently exploited to generate random code snippets. Second, we extend random sampling by introducing two genetic algorithms (GAs) that aim to generate more diverse input programs. Our case study shows that the proposed approach effectively detects bugs in K1 and K2; these bugs have been confirmed and (some) fixed by JetBrains developers. While we do not observe a significant difference w.r.t. the number of defects uncovered by the different search algorithms, random search and GAs are complementary as they find different categories of bugs. Finally, we provide insights into the relationships between the size, complexity, and fault detection capability of the generated input programs.",

Code mutations are small changes that alter the semantics of the original code, creating a mismatch with the natural language description. We apply different types of code mutations, such as operator replacement and statement deletion, to generate inconsistent code-description pairs. We then use these pairs to test the ability of LLMs to correctly detect the inconsistencies.\n  We propose a new LLM testing method, called Mutation-based Consistency Testing (MCT), and conduct a case study on the two popular LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, using the state-of-the-art code generation benchmark, HumanEval-X, which consists of six programming languages (Python, C++, Java, Go, JavaScript, and Rust). We compare the performance of the LLMs across different types of code mutations and programming languages and analyze the results. We find that the LLMs show significant variation in their code understanding performance and that they have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the mutation type and language.",

However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial and four open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while closed-source models exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models relatively lower pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging.",

These samples were obtained from various sources, including 80 from Quescol, 3,264 from Kaggle, and 1,725 from LeetCode. From the dataset, we created 13 sets of code problem variant prompts, which were used to instruct ChatGPT to generate the outputs. Subsequently, we assessed the performance of five AIGC detectors.

        "Abstract": "Stakeholders constantly make assumptions in the development of deep learning (DL) frameworks. These assumptions are related to various types of software artifacts (e.g., requirements, design decisions, and technical debt) and can turn out to be invalid, leading to system failures. Existing approaches and tools for assumption management usually depend on manual identification of assumptions. However, assumptions are scattered in various sources (e.g., code comments, commits, pull requests, and issues) of DL framework development, and manually identifying assumptions has high costs. This study intends to evaluate different classification models for the purpose of identification with respect to assumptions from the point of view of developers and users in the context of DL framework projects (i.e., issues, pull requests, and commits) on GitHub. First, we constructed a new and largest dataset (i.e., the AssuEval dataset) of assumptions collected from the TensorFlow and Keras repositories on GitHub. Then we explored the performance of seven non-transformers based models (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Classification and Regression Trees), the ALBERT model, and three decoder-only models (i.e., ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) for identifying assumptions on the AssuEval dataset. The study results show that ALBERT achieves the best performance (f1-score: 0.9584) for identifying assumptions on the AssuEval dataset, which is much better than the other models (the 2nd best f1-score is 0.8858, achieved by the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model). Though ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are popular models, we do not recommend using them to identify assumptions in DL framework development because of their low performance. Fine-tuning ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other language models (e.g., Llama3, Falcon, and BLOOM) specifically for assumptions might improve their performance for assumption identification.",

        "Abstract": "CG-Kit is a new code generation toolkit that we propose as a solution for portability and maintainability for scientific computing applications. The development of CG-Kit is rooted in the urgent need created by the shifting landscape of high-performance computing platforms and the algorithmic complexities of a particular large-scale multiphysics application: Flash-X. This combination leads to unique challenges including handling an existing large code base in Fortran and/or C/C++, subdivision of code into a great variety of units supporting a wide range of physics and numerical methods, different parallelization techniques for distributed- and shared-memory systems and accelerator devices, and heterogeneity of computing platforms requiring coexisting variants of parallel algorithms. The challenges demand that developers determine custom abstractions and granularity for code generation. CG-Kit tackles this with standalone tools that can be combined into highly specific and, we argue, highly effective portability and maintainability tool chains. Here we present the design of our new tools: parametrized source trees, control flow graphs, and recipes. The tools are implemented in Python. Although the tools are agnostic to the programming language of the source code, we focus on C/C++ and Fortran. Code generation experiments demonstrate the generation of variants of parallel algorithms: first, multithreaded variants of the basic AXPY operation (scalar-vector addition and vector-vector multiplication) to introduce the application of CG-Kit tool chains; and second, variants of parallel algorithms within a hydrodynamics solver, called Spark, from Flash-X that operates on block-structured adaptive meshes. In summary, code generated by CG-Kit achieves a reduction by over 60% of the original C/C++/Fortran source code.",

We introduce AST-T5, a novel pretraining paradigm that leverages the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for enhanced code generation, transpilation, and understanding. Using dynamic programming, our AST-Aware Segmentation retains code structure, while our AST-Aware Span Corruption objective equips the model to reconstruct various code structures. Unlike other models, AST-T5 avoids intricate program analyses or architectural changes, so it integrates seamlessly with any encoder-decoder Transformer. Evaluations show that AST-T5 consistently outperforms similar-sized LMs across various code-related tasks. Structure-awareness makes AST-T5 particularly powerful in code-to-code tasks, surpassing CodeT5 by 2 points in exact match score for the Bugs2Fix task and by 3 points in exact match score for Java-C# Transpilation in CodeXGLUE.

Reasoning in DatalogMTL is, however, of high computational complexity, which makes reasoning in modern data-intensive applications challenging. In this paper we present a practical reasoning algorithm for the full DatalogMTL language, which we have implemented in a system called MeTeoR. Our approach effectively combines an optimised (but generally non-terminating) materialisation (a.k.a. forward chaining) procedure, which provides scalable behaviour, with an automata-based component that guarantees termination and completeness. To ensure favourable scalability of the materialisation component, we propose a novel seminaïve materialisation procedure for DatalogMTL enjoying the non-repetition property, which ensures that each specific rule application will be considered at most once throughout the entire execution of the algorithm. Moreover, our materialisation procedure is enhanced with additional optimisations which further reduce the number of redundant computations performed during materialisation by disregarding rules as soon as it is certain that they cannot derive new facts in subsequent materialisation steps. Our extensive evaluation supports the practicality of our approach.",

LLaMA Pro and its instruction-following counterpart (LLaMA Pro-Instruct) achieve advanced performance among various benchmarks, demonstrating superiority over existing open models in the LLaMA family and the immense potential of reasoning and addressing diverse tasks as an intelligent agent.

        "Abstract": "Open-source software (OSS) greatly facilitates program development for developers. However, the high number of vulnerabilities in open-source software is a major concern, including in Golang, a relatively new programming language. In contrast to other commonly used OSS package managers, Golang presents a distinctive feature whereby commits are prevalently used as dependency versions prior to their integration into official releases. This attribute can prove advantageous to users, as patch commits can be implemented in a timely manner before the releases. However, Golang employs a decentralized mechanism for managing dependencies, whereby dependencies are upheld and distributed in separate repositories. This approach can result in delays in the dissemination of patches and unresolved vulnerabilities.\n  To tackle the aforementioned concern, a comprehensive investigation was undertaken to examine the life cycle of vulnerability in Golang, commencing from its introduction and culminating with its rectification. To this end, a framework was established by gathering data from diverse sources and systematically amalgamating them with an algorithm to compute the lags in vulnerability patching. It turned out that 66.10% of modules in the Golang ecosystem were affected by vulnerabilities. Within the vulnerability life cycle, we found two kinds of lag impeding the propagation of vulnerability fixing. By analyzing reasons behind non-lagged and lagged vulnerabilities, timely releasing and indexing patch versions could significantly enhance ecosystem security.",

        "Abstract": "Accelerating programs is typically done by recognizing code idioms matching high-performance libraries or hardware interfaces. However, recognizing such idioms automatically is challenging. The idiom recognition machinery is difficult to write and requires expert knowledge. In addition, slight variations in the input program might hide the idiom and defeat the recognizer.\n  This paper advocates for the use of a minimalist functional array language supporting a small, but expressive, set of operators. The minimalist design leads to a tiny sets of rewrite rules, which encode the language semantics. Crucially, the same minimalist language is also used to encode idioms. This removes the need for hand-crafted analysis passes, or for having to learn a complex domain-specific language to define the idioms.\n  Coupled with equality saturation, this approach is able to match the core functions from the BLAS and PyTorch libraries on a set of computational kernels. Compared to reference C kernel implementations, the approach produces a geometric mean speedup of 1.46x for C programs using BLAS, when generating such programs from the high-level minimalist language.",

The first is an abstract construction, using Markov categories and monoidal indeterminates. The second and third are more concrete. The second is in terms of traditional measure theoretic probability, which covers 'black-and-white' graphons. The third is in terms of probability monads on the nominal sets of Gabbay and Pitts. Specifically, we use a variation of nominal sets induced by the theory of graphs, which covers Erdős-Rényi graphons. In this way, we build new models of graph probabilistic programming from graphons.",

ADL compilers rely on a hardware control interface to compose hardware units. There are two choices: static control, which relies on cycle-level timing; or dynamic control, which uses explicit signalling to avoid depending on timing details. Static control is efficient but brittle; dynamic control incurs hardware costs to support compositional reasoning. Piezo is an ADL compiler that unifies static and dynamic control in a single intermediate language (IL). Its key insight is that the IL's static fragment is a refinement of its dynamic fragment: static code admits a subset of the run-time behaviors of the dynamic equivalent. Piezo can optimize code by combining facts from static and dynamic submodules, and it opportunistically converts code from dynamic to static control styles. We implement Piezo as an extension to an existing dynamic ADL compiler, Calyx. We use Piezo to implement an MLIR frontend, a systolic array generator, and a packet-scheduling hardware generator to demonstrate its optimizations and the static-dynamic interactions it enables.",

        "Abstract": "(Source) code summarization is the task of automatically generating natural language summaries for given code snippets. Such summaries play a key role in helping developers understand and maintain source code. Recently, with the successful application of large language models (LLMs) in numerous fields, software engineering researchers have also attempted to adapt LLMs to solve code summarization tasks. The main adaptation schemes include instruction prompting and task-oriented fine-tuning. However, instruction prompting involves designing crafted prompts for zero-shot learning or selecting appropriate samples for few-shot learning and requires users to have professional domain knowledge, while task-oriented fine-tuning requires high training costs. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework for code summarization called PromptCS. PromptCS trains a prompt agent that can generate continuous prompts to unleash the potential for LLMs in code summarization. Compared to the human-written discrete prompt, the continuous prompts are produced under the guidance of LLMs and are therefore easier to understand by LLMs. PromptCS freezes the parameters of LLMs when training the prompt agent, which can greatly reduce the requirements for training resources. We evaluate PromptCS on the CodeSearchNet dataset involving multiple programming languages. The results show that PromptCS significantly outperforms instruction prompting schemes on all four widely used metrics. In some base LLMs, e.g., CodeGen-Multi-2B and StarCoderBase-1B and -3B, PromptCS even outperforms the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme. More importantly, the training efficiency of PromptCS is faster than the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme, with a more pronounced advantage on larger LLMs. The results of the human evaluation demonstrate that PromptCS can generate more good summaries compared to baselines.",

These concerns have escalated, given the complexity, scale, and heterogeneity of today's HPC software and hardware. If correctness is not proactively addressed, there is the risk of producing flawed science on top of unacceptable productivity losses faced by computational scientists and engineers. HPC systems are beginning to include data-driven methods, including machine learning and surrogate models, and their impact on overall HPC system correctness was also felt urgent to discuss.\n  Stakeholders of correctness in this space were identified to belong to several sub-disciplines of computer science; from computer architecture researchers who design special-purpose hardware that offers high energy efficiencies; numerical algorithm designers who develop efficient computational schemes based on reduced precision as well as reduced data movement; all the way to researchers in programming language and formal methods who seek methodologies for correct compilation and verification.

Even LLMs applied to tasks from the high-performance computing (HPC) domain are huge in size and demand expensive compute resources for training. This is partly because LLMs for HPC tasks are obtained by finetuning existing LLMs that support several natural and/or programming languages. We found this design choice confusing - why do we need LLMs trained on natural languages and programming languages unrelated to HPC for HPC-specific tasks? In this line of work, we aim to question choices made by existing LLMs by developing smaller language models (LMs) for specific domains - we call them domain-specific LMs. Specifically, we start with HPC as a domain and build an HPC-specific LM, named MonoCoder, which is orders of magnitude smaller than existing LMs but delivers better performance on non-HPC and HPC codes. Specifically, we pre-trained MonoCoder on an HPC-specific dataset (named HPCorpus) of C and C++ programs mined from GitHub. We evaluated the performance of MonoCoder against state-of-the-art multi-lingual LLMs. Results demonstrate that MonoCoder, although much smaller than existing LMs, outperforms other LLMs on normalized-perplexity tests (in relation to model size) while also delivering competing CodeBLEU scores for high-performance and parallel code generations. In other words, results suggest that MonoCoder understands HPC code better than state-of-the-art LLMs.",

        "Abstract": "The object oriented programming paradigm is widely used in science and engineering. Many open and commercial libraries are written in C++ and increasingly provide bindings to Python, which is much easier to learn, but still partly encourages the use of object oriented programming. However, scientific ideas are much more directly and meaningfully expressed in the purely functional programming paradigm. Here, we take a best practice example, CERNs Python binding for its ROOT library, designed to handle the enormous amounts of data generated by the worlds largest particle accelerator, and translate a simple segment of its tutorial into Clojure, a functional language from the Lisp family. The code examples demonstrate how a purely functional language straightforwardly expresses scientific ideas. Subsequently, we develop a compiled Lisp-C++ interoperation layer to access the ROOT library exclusively via functional code. To preserve the expressivity of the Lisp code, the type hints necessary for C++ code generation are stored in a separate file. The interop system presented here is a generic framework that, when provided with a suitable file of type hints, facilitates access to methods of arbitrary C++ libraries and platforms like real-time microcontrollers.",

        "Abstract": "Program reduction is a prevalent technique to facilitate compilers' debugging by automatically minimizing bug-triggering programs. Existing program reduction techniques are either generic across languages (e.g., Perses and Vulcan) or specifically customized for one certain language by employing language-specific features, like C-Reduce. However, striking the balance between generality across multiple programming languages and specificity to individual languages in program reduction is yet to be explored. This paper proposes LPR, the first technique utilizing LLMs to perform language-specific program reduction for multiple languages. The core insight is to utilize both the language-generic syntax level program reduction (e.g., Perses) and the language-specific semantic level program transformations learned by LLMs. Alternately, language-generic program reducers efficiently reduce programs into 1-tree-minimality, which is small enough to be manageable for LLMs; LLMs effectively transform programs via the learned semantics to expose new reduction opportunities for the language-generic program reducers to further reduce the programs. Our extensive evaluation on 50 benchmarks across three languages (C, Rust, and JavaScript) has highlighted LPR's practicality and superiority over Vulcan, the state-of-the-art language-generic program reducer. For effectiveness, LPR surpasses Vulcan by producing 24.93%, 4.47%, and 11.71% smaller programs on benchmarks in C, Rust and JavaScript. Moreover, LPR and Vulcan have demonstrated their potential to complement each other. By using Vulcan on LPR's output for C programs, we achieve program sizes comparable to those reduced by C-Reduce. For efficiency, LPR takes 10.77%, 34.88%, 36.96% less time than Vulcan to finish all benchmarks in C, Rust and JavaScript, separately.",

These include synthesizing code from natural language, synthesizing tests from code, and synthesizing explanations of code. In contrast, the behavior of instructional code editing with LLMs is understudied. These are tasks in which the model is provided a block of code and an instruction to modify the code. The editing instruction may ask for a feature to be added or removed, describe a bug and ask for a fix, or ask for a different kind of solution. We introduce a carefully crafted benchmark of code editing tasks and use it to evaluate several cutting edge LLMs. Our evaluation exposes a significant gap between the capabilities of state-of-the-art open and closed models. For example, even GPT-3.5-Turbo is better than the best open model at code editing tasks. We also introduce a new, carefully curated, permissively licensed training dataset of code editing tasks coupled with natural language instructions. Using this training dataset, we show that we can fine-tune open Code LLMs to significantly improve their code editing capabilities, closing the gap between open and closed models.

        "Abstract": "Large-scale cloud systems play a pivotal role in modern IT infrastructure. However, incidents occurring within these systems can lead to service disruptions and adversely affect user experience. To swiftly resolve such incidents, on-call engineers depend on crafting domain-specific language (DSL) queries to analyze telemetry data. However, writing these queries can be challenging and time-consuming. This paper presents a thorough empirical study on the utilization of queries of KQL, a DSL employed for incident management in a large-scale cloud management system at Microsoft. The findings obtained underscore the importance and viability of KQL queries recommendation to enhance incident management.\n  Building upon these valuable insights, we introduce Xpert, an end-to-end machine learning framework that automates KQL recommendation process. By leveraging historical incident data and large language models, Xpert generates customized KQL queries tailored to new incidents. Furthermore, Xpert incorporates a novel performance metric called Xcore, enabling a thorough evaluation of query quality from three comprehensive perspectives. We conduct extensive evaluations of Xpert, demonstrating its effectiveness in offline settings. Notably, we deploy Xpert in the real production environment of a large-scale incident management system in Microsoft, validating its efficiency in supporting incident management. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first empirical study of its kind, and Xpert stands as a pioneering DSL query recommendation framework designed for incident management.",

Many approaches have been proposed to augment API documentation by summarizing complementary information from external resources such as Stack Overflow. Existing extractive-based summarization approaches excel in producing faithful summaries that accurately represent the source content without input length restrictions. Nevertheless, they suffer from inherent readability limitations. On the other hand, our empirical study on the abstractive-based summarization method, i.e., GPT-4, reveals that GPT-4 can generate coherent and concise summaries but presents limitations in terms of informativeness and faithfulness.\n  We introduce APIDocBooster, an extract-then-abstract framework that seamlessly fuses the advantages of both extractive (i.e., enabling faithful summaries without length limitation) and abstractive summarization (i.e., producing coherent and concise summaries). APIDocBooster consists of two stages: (1) \\textbf{C}ontext-aware \\textbf{S}entence \\textbf{S}ection \\textbf{C}lassification (CSSC) and (2) \\textbf{UP}date \\textbf{SUM}marization (UPSUM). CSSC classifies API-relevant information collected from multiple sources into API documentation sections. UPSUM first generates extractive summaries distinct from the original API documentation and then generates abstractive summaries guided by extractive summaries through in-context learning.\n  To enable automatic evaluation of APIDocBooster, we construct the first dataset for API document augmentation. Our automatic evaluation results reveal that each stage in APIDocBooster outperforms its baselines by a large margin. Our human evaluation also demonstrates the superiority of APIDocBooster over GPT-4 and shows that it improves informativeness, relevance, and faithfulness by 13.89\\%, 15.15\\%, and 30.56\\%, respectively.",

Different from previous works that use parametric and CAD models to represent humans and objects, in this work, we propose a novel 3D geometric primitive-based language to encode both humans and objects. Given our new paradigm, humans and objects are all compositions of primitives instead of heterogeneous entities. Thus, mutual information learning may be achieved between the limited 3D data of humans and different object categories. Moreover, considering the simplicity of the expression and the richness of the information it contains, we choose the superquadric as the primitive representation. To explore an effective embedding of HAOI for the machine, we build a new benchmark on 3D HAOI consisting of primitives together with their images and propose a task requiring machines to recover 3D HAOI using primitives from images. Moreover, we propose a baseline of single-view 3D reconstruction on HAOI. We believe this primitive-based 3D HAOI representation would pave the way for 3D HAOI studies.

        "Abstract": "Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) have gained attention in recent years due to their promising power efficiency compared to traditional von Neumann architectures. To program these architectures using ordinary languages such as C, a dataflow compiler must transform the original sequential, imperative program into an equivalent dataflow graph, composed of dataflow operators running in parallel. This transformation is challenging since the asynchronous nature of dataflow graphs allows out-of-order execution of operators, leading to behaviors not present in the original imperative programs.\n  We address this challenge by developing a translation validation technique for dataflow compilers to ensure that the dataflow program has the same behavior as the original imperative program on all possible inputs and schedules of execution. We apply this method to a state-of-the-art dataflow compiler targeting the RipTide CGRA architecture. Our tool uncovers 8 compiler bugs where the compiler outputs incorrect dataflow graphs, including a data race that is otherwise hard to discover via testing. After repairing these bugs, our tool verifies the correct compilation of all programs in the RipTide benchmark suite.",

It occurs when the significant bits of the value with a bigger type size are truncated during value conversion to the smaller type. Utilizing one of the most powerful methods for path exploration and automated bug detection called dynamic symbolic execution (DSE), we propose the symbolic security predicate for numeric truncation error detection, developed on top of DSE tool Sydr. Firstly, we execute the program on the data, which does not lead to any errors. During program execution we update symbolic shadow stack and shadow registers to track symbolic sizes of the symbolic variables to avoid false positives. Then, if we meet the instruction, which truncates the symbolic variable, we build the security predicate, try to solve it with the SMT-solver and in case of success save new input file to reproduce the error. We tested our approach on Juliet Dynamic test suite for CWE-197 and achieved 100% accuracy. We approved the workability of our approach by detecting 12 new errors of numeric truncation in 5 different real-world open source projects within OSS-Sydr-Fuzz project. All of the errors were reported, most of the reports were equipped with appropriate fixes, successfully confirmed and applied by project maintainers.",

This level of expertise is not sufficient when compared to the rapid development of new hardware architectures. Towards advancing the whole code optimization process, recent approaches rely on machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. This paper introduces a new framework to decrease the complexity of code optimization. The proposed framework builds on large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) and enables LLMs to receive feedback from their environment (i.e., unit tests) during the fine-tuning process. We compare our framework with existing state-of-the-art models and show that it is more efficient with respect to speed and computational usage, as a result of the decrement in training steps and its applicability to models with fewer parameters. Additionally, our framework reduces the possibility of logical and syntactical errors. Toward evaluating our approach, we run several experiments on the PIE dataset using a CodeT5 language model and RRHF, a new reinforcement learning algorithm. We adopt a variety of evaluation metrics with regards to optimization quality, and speedup. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework has similar results in comparison with existing models using shorter training times and smaller pre-trained models. In particular, we accomplish an increase of 5.6% and 2.2 over the baseline models concerning the %OP T and SP metrics.",

Hence, we explore the practical application of LLMs in software testing within an industrial setting, focusing on their current use by professional testers. In this context, rather than relying on existing data, we conducted a cross-sectional survey and collected data within real working contexts, specifically, engaging with practitioners in industrial settings. We applied quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyze and synthesize our collected data. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs effectively enhance testing documents and significantly assist testing professionals in programming tasks like debugging and test case automation. LLMs can support individuals engaged in manual testing who need to code. However, it is crucial to emphasize that, at this early stage, software testing professionals should use LLMs with caution while well-defined methods and guidelines are being built for the secure adoption of these tools.",

        "Abstract": "With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in code generation, enabling LLMs to transform natural language into programming code. These Code LLMs have been widely accepted by massive users and organizations. However, a dangerous nature is hidden in the code, which is the existence of fatal vulnerabilities. While some LLM providers have attempted to address these issues by aligning with human guidance, these efforts fall short of making Code LLMs practical and robust. Without a deep understanding of the performance of the LLMs under the practical worst cases, it would be concerning to apply them to various real-world applications. In this paper, we answer the critical issue: Are existing Code LLMs immune to generating vulnerable code? If not, what is the possible maximum severity of this issue in practical deployment scenarios? In this paper, we introduce DeceptPrompt, a novel algorithm that can generate adversarial natural language instructions that drive the Code LLMs to generate functionality correct code with vulnerabilities. DeceptPrompt is achieved through a systematic evolution-based algorithm with a fine grain loss design. The unique advantage of DeceptPrompt enables us to find natural prefix/suffix with totally benign and non-directional semantic meaning, meanwhile, having great power in inducing the Code LLMs to generate vulnerable code. This feature can enable us to conduct the almost-worstcase red-teaming on these LLMs in a real scenario, where users are using natural language. Our extensive experiments and analyses on DeceptPrompt not only validate the effectiveness of our approach but also shed light on the huge weakness of LLMs in the code generation task. When applying the optimized prefix/suffix, the attack success rate (ASR) will improve by average 50% compared with no prefix/suffix applying.",

        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), as the case of OpenAI ChatGPT-4 Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalized through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI has launched the possibility to fine-tune their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the possibility to create customized GPT version deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. The objective of this research is to assess the potential of the customized GPTs that have recently been launched by OpenAI. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behavior was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP provided responses in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, and this is a matter of relevance, when explicitly asked for something like, \"I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,\" BSVP was capable of providing a far superior response: having access to contextual documentation, it could fulfill the request, something beyond ChatGPT-4 Turbo's capabilities. On the downside, the response times were generally higher. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. It appears that customized assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.",

        "Abstract": "Choosing an appropriate software development technology (e.g., programming language) is challenging due to the proliferation of diverse options. The selection of inappropriate technologies for development may have a far-reaching effect on software developers' career growth. Switching to a different technology after working with one may lead to a complex learning curve and, thus, be more challenging. Therefore, it is crucial for software developers to find technologies that have a high usage span. Intuitively, the usage span of a technology can be determined by the time span developers have used that technology. Existing literature focuses on the technology landscape to explore the complex and implicit dependencies among technologies but lacks formal studies to draw insights about their usage span. This paper investigates the technology usage span by analyzing the question and answering (Q&A) traces of Stack Overflow (SO), the largest technical Q&A website available to date. In particular, we analyze 6.7 million Q&A traces posted by about 97K active SO users and see what technologies have appeared in their questions or answers over 15 years. According to our analysis, C# and Java programming languages have a high usage span, followed by JavaScript. Besides, developers used the .NET framework, iOS & Windows Operating Systems (OS), and SQL query language for a long time (on average). Our study also exposes the emerging (i.e., newly growing) technologies. For example, usages of technologies such as SwiftUI, .NET-6.0, Visual Studio 2022, and Blazor WebAssembly framework are increasing. The findings from our study can assist novice developers, startup software industries, and software users in determining appropriate technologies. This also establishes an initial benchmark for future investigation on the use span of software technologies.",

While there is a growing body of research in computing education on utilizing large language models (LLMs) in generation and engagement with coding exercises, the use of LLMs for generating programming MCQs has not been extensively explored. We analyzed the capability of GPT-4 to produce multiple-choice questions (MCQs) aligned with specific learning objectives (LOs) from Python programming classes in higher education. Specifically, we developed an LLM-powered (GPT-4) system for generation of MCQs from high-level course context and module-level LOs. We evaluated 651 LLM-generated and 449 human-crafted MCQs aligned to 246 LOs from 6 Python courses. We found that GPT-4 was capable of producing MCQs with clear language, a single correct choice, and high-quality distractors. We also observed that the generated MCQs appeared to be well-aligned with the LOs. Our findings can be leveraged by educators wishing to take advantage of the state-of-the-art generative models to support MCQ authoring efforts.",

To assist this task, session-based languages can be endowed with reversibility mechanisms. In this paper we propose a language enriched with programming facilities to commit session interactions, to roll back the computation to a previous commit point, and to abort the session. Rollbacks in our language always bring the system to previous visited states and a rollback cannot bring the system back to a point prior to the last commit. Programmers are relieved from the burden of ensuring that a rollback never restores a checkpoint imposed by a session participant different from the rollback requester. Such undesired situations are prevented at design-time (statically) by relying on a decidable compliance check at the type level, implemented in MAUDE. We show that the language satisfies error-freedom and progress of a session.",

We first provide a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4's peiceived zero-shot performance on this task, considering various aspects such as problems' release time, difficulties, and types of errors encountered. Surprisingly, the peiceived performance of GPT-4 has experienced a cliff like decline in problems after September 2021 consistently across all the difficulties and types of problems, which shows the potential data contamination, as well as the challenges for any existing LLM to solve unseen complex reasoning problems. We further explore various approaches such as fine-tuning, Chain-of-Thought prompting and problem description simplification, unfortunately none of them is able to consistently mitigate the challenges. Through our work, we emphasis the importance of this excellent data source for assessing the genuine reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and foster the development of LLMs with stronger reasoning abilities and better generalization in the future.",

Despite significant achievements, they rely on enormous training data to acquire a broad spectrum of open-domain knowledge. Besides, their evaluation revolves around open-domain benchmarks like HumanEval, which primarily consist of programming contests. Therefore, it is hard to fully characterize the intricacies and challenges associated with particular domains (e.g., web, game, and math). In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of the LLMs in domain-specific code generation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit sub-optimal performance in generating domain-specific code, due to their limited proficiency in utilizing domain-specific libraries. We further observe that incorporating API knowledge as prompts can empower LLMs to generate more professional code. Based on these findings, we further investigate how to effectively incorporate API knowledge into the code generation process. We experiment with three strategies for incorporating domain knowledge, namely, external knowledge inquirer, chain-of-thought prompting, and chain-of-thought fine-tuning. We refer to these strategies as a new code generation approach called DomCoder. Experimental results show that all strategies of DomCoder lead to improvement in the effectiveness of domain-specific code generation under certain settings.",

This study probes into ALMs' deployment in electronic hardware design, with a specific emphasis on the synthesis and enhancement of Verilog programming. We introduce an innovative framework, crafted to assess and amplify ALMs' productivity in this niche. The methodology commences with the initial crafting of Verilog programming via ALMs, succeeded by a distinct dual-stage refinement protocol. The premier stage prioritizes augmenting the code's operational and linguistic precision, while the latter stage is dedicated to aligning the code with Power-Performance-Area (PPA) benchmarks, a pivotal component in proficient hardware design. This bifurcated strategy, merging error remediation with PPA enhancement, has yielded substantial upgrades in the caliber of ALM-created Verilog programming. Our framework achieves an 81.37% rate in linguistic accuracy and 62.0% in operational efficacy in programming synthesis, surpassing current leading-edge techniques, such as 73% in linguistic accuracy and 46% in operational efficacy. These findings illuminate ALMs' aptitude in tackling complex technical domains and signal a positive shift in the mechanization of hardware design operations.",

        "Abstract": "Programming language understanding and representation (a.k.a code representation learning) has always been a hot and challenging task in software engineering. It aims to apply deep learning techniques to produce numerical representations of the source code features while preserving its semantics. These representations can be used for facilitating subsequent code-related tasks. The abstract syntax tree (AST), a fundamental code feature, illustrates the syntactic information of the source code and has been widely used in code representation learning. However, there is still a lack of systematic and quantitative evaluation of how well AST-based code representation facilitates subsequent code-related tasks. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of the AST-based code representation in facilitating follow-up code-related tasks. To do so, we compare the performance of models trained with code token sequence (Token for short) based code representation and AST-based code representation on three popular types of code-related tasks. Surprisingly, the overall quantitative statistical results demonstrate that models trained with AST-based code representation consistently perform worse across all three tasks compared to models trained with Token-based code representation. Our further quantitative analysis reveals that models trained with AST-based code representation outperform models trained with Token-based code representation in certain subsets of samples across all three tasks. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate and reveal the impact of the choice of AST parsing/preprocessing/encoding methods on AST-based code representation and subsequent code-related tasks. Our study provides future researchers with detailed guidance on how to select solutions at each stage to fully exploit AST.",

        "Abstract": "Modern regex languages have strayed far from well-understood traditional regular expressions: they include features that fundamentally transform the matching problem. In exchange for these features, modern regex engines at times suffer from exponential complexity blowups, a frequent source of denial-of-service vulnerabilities in JavaScript applications. Worse, regex semantics differ across languages, and the impact of these divergences on algorithmic design and worst-case matching complexity has seldom been investigated.\n  This paper provides a novel perspective on JavaScript's regex semantics by identifying a larger-than-previously-understood subset of the language that can be matched with linear time guarantees. In the process, we discover several cases where state-of-the-art algorithms were either wrong (semantically incorrect), inefficient (suffering from superlinear complexity) or excessively restrictive (assuming certain features could not be matched linearly). We introduce novel algorithms to restore correctness and linear complexity. We further advance the state-of-the-art in linear regex matching by presenting the first nonbacktracking algorithms for matching lookarounds in linear time: one supporting captureless lookbehinds in any regex language, and another leveraging a JavaScript property to support unrestricted lookaheads and lookbehinds. Finally, we describe new time and space complexity tradeoffs for regex engines. All of our algorithms are practical: we validated them in a prototype implementation, and some have also been merged in the V8 JavaScript implementation used in Chrome and Node.js.",

Our approach begins with a unique dialog-based method, engaging with LLMs to establish a foundational understanding of zero-shot 3DVG. Building on this, we design a visual program that consists of three types of modules, i.e., view-independent, view-dependent, and functional modules. These modules, specifically tailored for 3D scenarios, work collaboratively to perform complex reasoning and inference. Furthermore, we develop an innovative language-object correlation module to extend the scope of existing 3D object detectors into open-vocabulary scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot approach can outperform some supervised baselines, marking a significant stride towards effective 3DVG.",

To address this objective ``Explain-in-Plain-English'' questions, in which students are shown a segment of code and asked to provide an abstract description of the code's purpose, have been adopted. However, given EiPE questions require a natural language response, they often require manual grading which is time-consuming for course staff and delays feedback for students. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating code, responses to EiPE questions can be used to generate code segments, the correctness of which can then be easily verified using test cases. We refer to this approach as \"Code Generation Based Grading\" (CGBG) and in this paper we explore its agreement with human graders using EiPE responses from past exams in an introductory programming course taught in Python. Overall, we find that CGBG achieves moderate agreement with human graders with the primary area of disagreement being its leniency with respect to low-level and line-by-line descriptions of code.",

In this paper, we propose a novel tool, called CNL2ASP, for translating English sentences expressed in a controlled natural language (CNL) form into ASP. In particular, we first provide a definition of the type of sentences allowed by our CNL and their translation as ASP rules, and then exemplify the usage of the CNL for the specification of both synthetic and real-world combinatorial problems. Finally, we report the results of an experimental analysis conducted on the real-world problems to compare the performance of automatically generated encodings with the ones written by ASP practitioners, showing that our tool can obtain satisfactory performance on these benchmarks.

        "Abstract": "While most conversational agents are grounded on either free-text or structured knowledge, many knowledge corpora consist of hybrid sources. This paper presents the first conversational agent that supports the full generality of hybrid data access for large knowledge corpora, through a language we developed called SUQL (Structured and Unstructured Query Language). Specifically, SUQL extends SQL with free-text primitives (summary and answer), so information retrieval can be composed with structured data accesses arbitrarily in a formal, succinct, precise, and interpretable notation. With SUQL, we propose the first semantic parser, an LLM with in-context learning, that can handle hybrid data sources.\n  Our in-context learning-based approach, when applied to the HybridQA dataset, comes within 8.9% exact match and 7.1% F1 of the SOTA, which was trained on 62K data samples. More significantly, unlike previous approaches, our technique is applicable to large databases and free-text corpora. We introduce a dataset consisting of crowdsourced questions and conversations on Yelp, a large, real restaurant knowledge base with structured and unstructured data. We show that our few-shot conversational agent based on SUQL finds an entity satisfying all user requirements 90.3% of the time, compared to 63.4% for a baseline based on linearization.",

        "Abstract": "Dancing Links connotes an optimization to a circular doubly-linked list data structure implementation which provides for fast list element removal and restoration.  The Dancing Links optimization is used primarily in fast algorithms to find exact covers, and has been popularized by Knuth  in Volume 4B of his seminal series The Art of Computer Programming. We describe an implementation of the Dancing Links optimization in the Rust programming language, as well as its formal verification using the ACL2 theorem prover.  Rust has garnered significant endorsement in the past few years as a modern, memory-safe successor to C/C++ at companies such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and is being integrated into both the Linux and Windows operating system kernels. Our interest in Rust stems from its potential as a hardware/software co-assurance language, with application to critical systems.  We have crafted a Rust subset, inspired by Russinoff's Restricted Algorithmic C (RAC), which we have imaginatively named Restricted Algorithmic Rust, or RAR.  In previous work, we described our initial implementation of a RAR toolchain, wherein we simply transpile the RAR source into RAC.  By so doing,  we leverage a number of existing hardware/software co-assurance tools with a minimum investment of time and effort.  In this paper, we describe the RAR Rust subset, describe our improved prototype RAR toolchain, and detail the design and verification of a circular doubly-linked list data structure employing the Dancing Links optimization in RAR, with full proofs of functional correctness accomplished using the ACL2 theorem prover.",

        "Abstract": "All major weather and climate applications are currently developed using languages such as Fortran or C++. This is typical in the domain of high performance computing (HPC), where efficient execution is an important concern. Unfortunately, this approach leads to implementations that intermix optimizations for specific hardware architectures with the high-level numerical methods that are typical for the domain. This leads to code that is verbose, difficult to extend and maintain, and difficult to port to different hardware architectures. Here, we propose a different strategy based on GT4Py (GridTools for Python). GT4Py is a Python framework to write weather and climate applications that includes a high-level embedded domain specific language (DSL) to write stencil computations. The toolchain integrated in GT4Py enables automatic code-generation,to obtain the performance of state-of-the-art C++ and CUDA implementations. The separation of concerns between the mathematical definitions and the actual implementations allows for performance portability of the computations on a wide range of computing architectures, while being embedded in Python allows easy access to the tools of the Python ecosystem to enhance the productivity of the scientists and facilitate integration in complex workflows. Here, the initial release of GT4Py is described, providing an overview of the current state of the framework and performance results showing how GT4Py can outperform pure Python implementations by orders of magnitude.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software engineering (SE) by enhancing software development efficiency. The advent of pre-trained models (PTMs) leveraging transfer learning has significantly advanced AI for SE. However, existing PTMs that operate on individual code tokens suffer from several limitations: They are costly to train and fine-tune; and they rely heavily on labeled data for fine-tuning on task-specific datasets. In this paper, we present TransformCode, a novel framework that learns code embeddings in a contrastive learning manner. Our framework is encoder-agnostic and language-agnostic, which means that it can leverage any encoder model and handle any programming language. We also propose a novel data-augmentation technique called abstract syntax tree (AST) transformation, which applies syntactic and semantic transformations to the original code snippets, to generate more diverse and robust samples for contrastive learning. Our framework has several advantages over existing methods: (1) It is flexible and adaptable, because it can easily be extended to other downstream tasks that require code representation (such as code-clone detection and classification); (2) it is efficient and scalable, because it does not require a large model or a large amount of training data, and it can support any programming language; (3) it is not limited to unsupervised learning, but can also be applied to some supervised learning tasks by incorporating task-specific labels or objectives; and (4) it can also adjust the number of encoder parameters based on computing resources. We evaluate our framework on several code-related tasks, and demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority over the state-of-the-art methods such as SourcererCC, Code2vec, and InferCode.",

We break down code processing models into general language models represented by the GPT family and specialized models that are specifically pretrained on code, often with tailored objectives. We discuss the relations and differences between these models, and highlight the historical transition of code modeling from statistical models and RNNs to pretrained Transformers and LLMs, which is exactly the same course that had been taken by NLP. We also go beyond programming and review LLMs' application in other software engineering activities including requirement engineering, testing, deployment, and operations in an endeavor to provide a global view of NLP in SE, and identify key challenges and potential future directions in this domain.

On one hand, prototyping in a production compiler can be cumbersome, as they are often optimized for program compilation speed at the expense of software simplicity and development speed. On the other hand, the transition from a prototype compiler to production requires significant engineering work. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of sidekick compiler frameworks, an approach that uses multiple frameworks that interoperate with each other by leveraging textual interchange formats and declarative descriptions of abstractions. Each such compiler framework is specialized for specific use cases, such as performance or prototyping. Abstractions are by design shared across frameworks, simplifying the transition from prototyping to production. We demonstrate this idea with xDSL, a sidekick for MLIR focused on prototyping and teaching. xDSL interoperates with MLIR through a shared textual IR and the exchange of IRs through an IR Definition Language. The benefits of sidekick compiler frameworks are evaluated by showing on three use cases how xDSL impacts their development: teaching, DSL compilation, and rewrite system prototyping. We also investigate the trade-offs that xDSL offers, and demonstrate how we simplify the transition between frameworks using the IRDL dialect. With sidekick compilation, we envision a future in which engineers minimize the cost of development by choosing a framework built for their immediate needs, and later transitioning to production with minimal overhead.",

As a young technology, Wasm continues to evolve -- it reached version 2.0 last year and another major update is expected soon.\n  For a new feature to be standardised in Wasm, four key artefacts must be presented: a formal (mathematical) specification of the feature, an accompanying prose pseudocode description, an implementation in the official reference interpreter, and a suite of unit tests. This rigorous process helps to avoid errors in the design and implementation of new Wasm features, and Wasm's distinctive formal specification in particular has facilitated machine-checked proofs of various correctness properties for the language. However, manually crafting all of these artefacts requires expert knowledge combined with repetitive and tedious labor, which is a burden on the language's standardization process and authoring of the specification.\n  This paper presents Wasm SpecTec, a technology to express the formal specification of Wasm through a domain-specific language. This DSL allows all of Wasm's currently handwritten specification artefacts to be error-checked and generated automatically from a single source of truth, and is designed to be easy to write, read, compare, and review. We believe that Wasm SpecTec's automation and meta-level error checking will significantly ease the current burden of the language's specification authors. We demonstrate the current capabilities of Wasm SpecTec by showcasing its proficiency in generating various artefacts, and describe our work towards replacing the manually written official Wasm specification document with specifications generated by Wasm SpecTec.",

        "Abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a practical approach to secure computation over encrypted data. However, writing programs with efficient HE implementations remains the purview of experts. A difficult barrier for programmability is that efficiency requires operations to be vectorized in inobvious ways, forcing efficient HE programs to manipulate ciphertexts with complex data layouts and to interleave computations with data movement primitives.\n  We present Viaduct-HE, a compiler generates efficient vectorized HE programs. Viaduct-HE can generate both the operations and complex data layouts required for efficient HE programs. The source language of Viaduct-HE is array-oriented, enabling the compiler to have a simple representation of possible vectorization schedules. With such a representation, the compiler searches the space of possible vectorization schedules and finds those with efficient data layouts. After finding a vectorization schedule, Viaduct-HE further optimizes HE programs through term rewriting. The compiler has extension points to customize the exploration of vectorization schedules, to customize the cost model for HE programs, and to add back ends for new HE libraries.\n  Our evaluation of the prototype Viaduct-HE compiler shows that it produces efficient vectorized HE programs with sophisticated data layouts and optimizations comparable to those designed by experts.",

        "Abstract": "Current approaches for collision avoidance and space traffic management face many challenges, mainly due to the continuous increase in the number of objects in orbit and the lack of scalable and automated solutions. To avoid catastrophic incidents, satellite owners/operators must be aware of their assets' collision risk to decide whether a collision avoidance manoeuvre needs to be performed. This process is typically executed through the use of warnings issued in the form of CDMs which contain information about the event, such as the expected TCA and the probability of collision. Our previous work presented a statistical learning model that allowed us to answer two important questions: (1) Will any new conjunctions be issued in the next specified time interval? (2) When and with what uncertainty will the next CDM arrive? However, the model was based on an empirical Bayes homogeneous Poisson process, which assumes that the arrival rates of CDMs are constant over time. In fact, the rate at which the CDMs are issued depends on the behaviour of the objects as well as on the screening process performed by third parties. Thus, in this work, we extend the previous study and propose a Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson process implemented with high precision using a Probabilistic Programming Language to fully describe the underlying phenomena. We compare the proposed solution with a baseline model to demonstrate the added value of our approach. The results show that this problem can be successfully modelled by our Bayesian non-homogeneous Poisson Process with greater accuracy, contributing to the development of automated collision avoidance systems and helping operators react timely but sparingly with satellite manoeuvres.",

        "Abstract": "The expanding hardware diversity in high performance computing adds enormous complexity to scientific software development. Developers who aim to write maintainable software have two options: 1) To use a so-called data locality abstraction that handles portability internally, thereby, performance-productivity becomes a trade off. Such abstractions usually come in the form of libraries, domain-specific languages, and run-time systems. 2) To use generic programming where performance, productivity and portability are subject to software design. In the direction of the second, this work describes a design approach that allows the integration of low-level and verbose programming tools into high-level generic algorithms based on template meta-programming in C++. This enables the development of performance-portable applications targeting host-device computer architectures, such as CPUs and GPUs. With a suitable design in place, the extensibility of generic algorithms to new hardware becomes a well defined procedure that can be developed in isolation from other parts of the code. That allows scientific software to be maintainable and efficient in a period of diversifying hardware in HPC. As proof of concept, a finite-difference modelling algorithm for the acoustic wave equation is developed and benchmarked using roofline model analysis on Intel Xeon Gold 6248 CPU, Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU, and AMD MI100 GPU.",

        "Abstract": "Recent works have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) could empower traditional neuro-symbolic models via programming capabilities to translate language into module descriptions, thus achieving strong visual reasoning results while maintaining the model's transparency and efficiency. However, these models usually exhaustively generate the entire code snippet given each new instance of a task, which is extremely ineffective. We propose generative neuro-symbolic visual reasoning by growing and reusing modules. Specifically, our model consists of three unique stages, module initialization, module generation, and module execution. First, given a vision-language task, we adopt LLMs to examine whether we could reuse and grow over established modules to handle this new task. If not, we initialize a new module needed by the task and specify the inputs and outputs of this new module. After that, the new module is created by querying LLMs to generate corresponding code snippets that match the requirements. In order to get a better sense of the new module's ability, we treat few-shot training examples as test cases to see if our new module could pass these cases. If yes, the new module is added to the module library for future reuse. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our model on the testing set by executing the parsed programs with the newly made visual modules to get the results. We find the proposed model possesses several advantages. First, it performs competitively on standard tasks like visual question answering and referring expression comprehension; Second, the modules learned from one task can be seamlessly transferred to new tasks; Last but not least, it is able to adapt to new visual reasoning tasks by observing a few training examples and reusing modules.",

To address this, we examine a framework for parallel corpus mining, which provides a quick and effective way to mine a parallel corpus from publicly available lectures on Coursera. To create the parallel corpora, we propose a dynamic programming based sentence alignment algorithm which leverages the cosine similarity of machine-translated sentences. The sentence alignment F1 score reaches 96%, which is higher than using the BERTScore, LASER, or sentBERT methods. For both English--Japanese and English--Chinese lecture translations, we extracted parallel corpora of approximately 50,000 lines and created development and test sets through manual filtering for benchmarking translation performance. Through machine translation experiments, we show that the mined corpora enhance the quality of lecture transcript translation when used in conjunction with out-of-domain parallel corpora via multistage fine-tuning. Furthermore, this study also suggests guidelines for gathering and cleaning corpora, mining parallel sentences, cleaning noise in the mined data, and creating high-quality evaluation splits. For the sake of reproducibility, we have released the corpora as well as the code to create them. The dataset is available at https://github.com/shyyhs/CourseraParallelCorpusMining.",

        "Abstract": "The utilization of performance monitoring probes is a valuable tool for programmers to gather performance data. However, the manual insertion of these probes can result in an increase in code size, code obfuscation, and an added burden of learning different APIs associated with performance monitoring tools. To mitigate these issues, EDPM, an embedded domain-specific language, was developed to provide a higher level of abstraction for annotating regions of code that require instrumentation in C and C++ programs. This paper presents the design and implementation of EDPM and compares it to the well-known tool PAPI, in terms of required lines of code, flexibility in configuring regions, and performance overhead. The results of this study demonstrate that EDPM is a low-resolution profiling tool that offers a reduction in required lines of code and enables programmers to express various configurations of regions. Furthermore, the design of EDPM is such that its pragmas are ignored by the standard compiler, allowing for seamless integration into existing software processes without disrupting build systems or increasing the size of the executable. Additionally, the design of the EDPM pre-compiler allows for the extension of available performance counters while maintaining a high level of abstraction for programmers. Therefore, EDPM offers a promising solution to simplify and optimize performance monitoring in C and C++ programs.",

Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification.\n  In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.",

The success of these models has driven demand for deploying them to a diverse set of backend environments. In this paper, we present Relax, a compiler abstraction for optimizing end-to-end dynamic machine learning workloads. Relax introduces first-class symbolic shape annotations to track dynamic shape computations globally across the program. It also introduces a cross-level abstraction that encapsulates computational graphs, loop-level tensor programs, and library calls in a single representation to enable cross-level optimizations. We build an end-to-end compilation framework using the proposed approach to optimize dynamic shape models. Experimental results on large language models show that Relax delivers performance competitive with state-of-the-art hand-optimized systems across platforms and enables deployment of emerging dynamic models to a broader set of environments, including mobile phones, embedded devices, and web browsers.",

This is because low-level implementation languages like C do not help math library developers catch mathematical errors, build implementations incrementally, or separate high-level and low-level decision making. This ultimately puts development of such functions out of reach for all but the most experienced experts. To address this, we introduce MegaLibm, a domain-specific language for implementing, testing, and tuning math library implementations. MegaLibm is safe, modular, and tunable. Implementations in MegaLibm can automatically detect mathematical mistakes like sign flips via semantic wellformedness checks, and components like range reductions can be implemented in a modular, composable way, simplifying implementations. Once the high-level algorithm is done, tuning parameters like working precisions and evaluation schemes can be adjusted through orthogonal tuning parameters to achieve the desired speed and accuracy. MegaLibm also enables math library developers to work interactively, compiling, testing, and tuning their implementations and invoking tools like Sollya and type-directed synthesis to complete components and synthesize entire implementations. MegaLibm can express 8 state-of-the-art math library implementations with comparable speed and accuracy to the original C code, and can synthesize 5 variations and 3 from-scratch implementations with minimal guidance.",

Although LLMs can help developers to be more productive, prior empirical studies have shown that LLMs can generate insecure code. There are two contributing factors to the insecure code generation. First, existing datasets used to evaluate LLMs do not adequately represent genuine software engineering tasks sensitive to security. Instead, they are often based on competitive programming challenges or classroom-type coding tasks. In real-world applications, the code produced is integrated into larger codebases, introducing potential security risks. Second, existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on the functional correctness of the generated code while ignoring security considerations. Therefore, in this paper, we described SALLM, a framework to benchmark LLMs' abilities to generate secure code systematically. This framework has three major components: a novel dataset of security-centric Python prompts, configurable assessment techniques to evaluate the generated code, and novel metrics to evaluate the models' performance from the perspective of secure code generation.",

Specifically, we build and analyze multiple types of comparable corpora, including programs generated from natural language documentation using a code generation model. Furthermore, to reduce overfitting to a single reference translation, we automatically generate additional translation references for available parallel data and filter the translations by unit tests, which increases variation in target translations. Experiments show that our data augmentation techniques significantly improve CodeT5 for translation between Java, Python, and C++ by an average of 7.5% Computational Accuracy (CA@1), which verifies the correctness of translations by execution.

Next, we conduct an interview study with ten student participants and apply grounded theory to help analyze insightful findings regarding the benefits, challenges, and expectations of students on AI code completion. Our findings show that AI code completion enhanced students' productivity and efficiency by providing correct syntax suggestions, offering alternative solutions, and functioning as a coding tutor. However, the over-reliance on AI code completion may lead to a surface-level understanding of programming concepts, diminishing problem-solving skills and restricting creativity.

Such policies may decrease the performance and the security of the application due to locality issues (e.g., functions executed by workers far from the databases to be accessed). These limitations are partially overcome by the adoption of APP, a new platform-agnostic declarative language that allows serverless platforms to support multiple scheduling logics. Defining the \"right\" scheduling policy in APP is far from being a trivial task since it often requires rounds of refinement involving knowledge of the underlying infrastructure, guesswork, and empirical testing. In this paper, we start investigating how information derived from static analysis could be incorporated into APP scheduling function policies to help users select the best-performing workers at function allocation. We substantiate our proposal by presenting a pipeline able to extract cost equations from functions' code, synthesising cost expressions through the usage of off-the-shelf solvers, and extending APP allocation policies to consider this information.",

Spreadsheet software allows users to automatically format their tables by writing data-dependent conditional formatting (CF) rules. Writing such rules is often challenging for users as it requires them to understand and implement the underlying logic. We present FormaT5, a transformer-based model that can generate a CF rule given the target table and a natural language description of the desired formatting logic. We find that user descriptions for these tasks are often under-specified or ambiguous, making it harder for code generation systems to accurately learn the desired rule in a single step. To tackle this problem of under-specification and minimise argument errors, FormaT5 learns to predict placeholders though an abstention objective. These placeholders can then be filled by a second model or, when examples of rows that should be formatted are available, by a programming-by-example system. To evaluate FormaT5 on diverse and real scenarios, we create an extensive benchmark of 1053 CF tasks, containing real-world descriptions collected from four different sources. We release our benchmarks to encourage research in this area. Abstention and filling allow FormaT5 to outperform 8 different neural approaches on our benchmarks, both with and without examples.

        "Abstract": "Rust programming language is gaining popularity rapidly in building reliable and secure systems due to its security guarantees and outstanding performance. To provide extra functionalities, the Rust compiler introduces Rust unstable features (RUF) to extend compiler functionality, syntax, and standard library support. However, these features are unstable and may get removed, introducing compilation failures to dependent packages. Even worse, their impacts propagate through transitive dependencies, causing large-scale failures in the whole ecosystem. Although RUF is widely used in Rust, previous research has primarily concentrated on Rust code safety, with the usage and impacts of RUF from the Rust compiler remaining unexplored. Therefore, we aim to bridge this gap by systematically analyzing the RUF usage and impacts in the Rust ecosystem. We propose novel techniques for extracting RUF precisely, and to assess its impact on the entire ecosystem quantitatively, we accurately resolve package dependencies. We have analyzed the whole Rust ecosystem with 590K package versions and 140M transitive dependencies. Our study shows that the Rust ecosystem uses 1000 different RUF, and at most 44% of package versions are affected by RUF, causing compiling failures for at most 12%. To mitigate wide RUF impacts, we further design and implement a RUF-compilation-failure recovery tool that can recover up to 90% of the failure. We believe our techniques, findings, and tools can help to stabilize the Rust compiler, ultimately enhancing the security and reliability of the Rust ecosystem.",

        "Abstract": "The Julia programming language was designed to fill the needs of scientific computing by combining the benefits of productivity and performance languages. Julia allows users to write untyped scripts easily without needing to worry about many implementation details, as do other productivity languages. If one just wants to get the work done-regardless of how efficient or general the program might be, such a paradigm is ideal. Simultaneously, Julia also allows library developers to write efficient generic code that can run as fast as implementations in performance languages such as C or Fortran. This combination of user-facing ease and library developer-facing performance has proven quite attractive, and the language has increasing adoption.\n  With adoption comes combinatorial challenges to correctness. Multiple dispatch -- Julia's key mechanism for abstraction -- allows many libraries to compose \"out of the box.\" However, it creates bugs where one library's requirements do not match what another provides. Typing could address this at the cost of Julia's flexibility for scripting.\n  I developed a \"best of both worlds\" solution: gradual typing for Julia. My system forms the core of a gradual type system for Julia, laying the foundation for improving the correctness of Julia programs while not getting in the way of script writers. My framework allows methods to be individually typed or untyped, allowing users to write untyped code that interacts with typed library code and vice versa. Typed methods then get a soundness guarantee that is robust in the presence of both dynamically typed code and dynamically generated definitions. I additionally describe protocols, a mechanism for typing abstraction over concrete implementation that accommodates one common pattern in Julia libraries, and describe its implementation into my typed Julia framework.",

        "Abstract": "Compiler correctness is crucial, as miscompilation can falsify program behaviors, leading to serious consequences. Fuzzing has been studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates tests without sufficient understanding of internal compiler behaviors. Meanwhile, traditional white-box techniques, like symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compilers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks. Nonetheless, guiding LLMs with compiler source-code information remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing.\n  To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer using LLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization, with a spotlight on detecting deep logic bugs in the deep learning (DL) compilers. WhiteFox adopts a multi-agent framework: an LLM-based analysis agent examines the low-level optimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level test programs that can trigger the optimization; an LLM-based generation agent produces test programs based on the summarized requirements. Additionally, optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to enhance the generation on the fly. Our evaluation on the three most popular DL compilers (i.e., PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite) shows WhiteFox can generate high-quality test programs to exercise deep optimizations, practicing up to 8X more than state-of-the-art fuzzers. WhiteFox has found 101 bugs for the DL compilers, with 92 confirmed as previously unknown and 70 fixed. WhiteFox has been acknowledged by the PyTorch team and is being incorporated into its development workflow. Beyond DL compilers, WhiteFox can also be adapted for compilers in different domains.",

Running entire applications inside enclaves is possible, but this approach leads to a large trusted computing base (TCB). As such, various tools have been developed to partition programs written in languages such as C or Java into \\emph{trusted} and \\emph{untrusted} parts, which are run in and out of enclaves respectively. However, those tools depend on language-specific taint-analysis and partitioning techniques. They cannot be reused for other languages and there is thus a need for tools that transcend this language barrier.\n  We address this challenge by proposing a multi-language technique to specify sensitive code or data, as well as a multi-language tool to analyse and partition the resulting programs for trusted execution environments like Intel SGX. We leverage GraalVM's Truffle framework, which provides a language-agnostic abstract syntax tree (AST) representation for programs, to provide special AST nodes called \\emph{secure nodes} that encapsulate sensitive program information. Secure nodes can easily be embedded into the ASTs of a wide range of languages via Truffle's \\emph{polyglot API}. Our technique includes a multi-language dynamic taint tracking tool to analyse and partition applications based on our generic secure nodes. Our extensive evaluation with micro- and macro-benchmarks shows that we can use our technique for two languages (Javascript and \\python), and that partitioned programs can obtain up to $14.5\\%$ performance improvement as compared to unpartitioned versions.",

Experts are obtained by StarCoder fine-tuning. Specifically, we use a Low-Rank Adaptive Method (LoRA) technique, limiting each expert size as only 0.06% of number of StarCoder's parameters. At the same time, to enhance training efficiency in terms of time, we adopt curriculum learning strategy and use self-instruct data for efficient fine-tuning. As a result, each expert takes only 6 hours to train on one single 80Gb A100 HBM. With experiments on XLCoST datasets, SteloCoder achieves an average of 73.76 CodeBLEU score in multi-programming language-to-Python translation, surpassing the top performance from the leaderboard by at least 3.5. This accomplishment is attributed to only 45M extra parameters with StarCoder as the backbone and 32 hours of valid training on one 80GB A100 HBM.

        "Abstract": "Logical reasoning, i.e., deductively inferring the truth value of a conclusion from a set of premises, is an important task for artificial intelligence with wide potential impacts on science, mathematics, and society. While many prompting-based strategies have been proposed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to do such reasoning more effectively, they still appear unsatisfactory, often failing in subtle and unpredictable ways. In this work, we investigate the validity of instead reformulating such tasks as modular neurosymbolic programming, which we call LINC: Logical Inference via Neurosymbolic Computation. In LINC, the LLM acts as a semantic parser, translating premises and conclusions from natural language to expressions in first-order logic. These expressions are then offloaded to an external theorem prover, which symbolically performs deductive inference. Leveraging this approach, we observe significant performance gains on FOLIO and a balanced subset of ProofWriter for three different models in nearly all experimental conditions we evaluate. On ProofWriter, augmenting the comparatively small open-source StarCoder+ (15.5B parameters) with LINC even outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by an absolute 38% and 10%, respectively. When used with GPT-4, LINC scores 26% higher than CoT on ProofWriter while performing comparatively on FOLIO. Further analysis reveals that although both methods on average succeed roughly equally often on this dataset, they exhibit distinct and complementary failure modes. We thus provide promising evidence for how logical reasoning over natural language can be tackled through jointly leveraging LLMs alongside symbolic provers.

However, we observe that current program translation models still make elementary syntax errors, particularly, when the target language does not have syntax elements in the source language. Metrics like BLUE, CodeBLUE and computation accuracy may not expose these issues. In this paper we introduce a new metrics for programming language translation and these metrics address these basic syntax errors. We develop a novel active defects probing suite called Syntactic Unit Tests (SUT) which includes a highly interpretable evaluation harness for accuracy and test scoring. Experiments have shown that even powerful models like ChatGPT still make mistakes on these basic unit tests. Specifically, compared to previous program translation task evaluation dataset, its pass rate on our unit tests has decreased by 26.15%. Further our evaluation harness reveal syntactic element errors in which these models exhibit deficiencies.",

We developed a software framework for authoring transparent, reusable and updatable Computational Health Economic Models (CHEMs) (the software files that implement health economic models). We specified framework user requirements of a template CHEM module that facilitates modular model implementations, a simple programming syntax and tools for authoring new CHEM modules, supplying CHEMs with data, reporting reproducible CHEM analyses, searching for CHEM modules and maintaining a CHEM project website. We implemented the framework as six development version code libraries in the programming language R that integrate with online services for software development and research data archiving. We used the framework to author five development version R libraries of CHEM modules focused on utility mapping in youth mental health. These modules provide tools for variable validation, dataset description, multi-attribute instrument scoring, construction of mapping models, reporting of mapping studies and making out of sample predictions. We assessed these CHEM module libraries as mostly meeting transparency, reusability and updatability criteria that we have previously developed, but requiring more detailed documentation and unit testing of individual modules. Our software framework has potential value as a prototype for future tools to support the development of transferable CHEMs.",

The first map corresponds to an $8^{\\text{th}}$ root of the identity morphism on the unit $1$. The second map corresponds to a square root of the symmetry on $1+1$. As square roots are generally not unique and can sometimes even be trivial, the maps are constrained to satisfy a nondegeneracy axiom, which we relate to the Euler decomposition of the Hadamard gate. The semantic construction is turned into an extension of \\PiLang, called \\SPiLang, that is a computationally universal quantum programming language equipped with an equational theory that is sound and complete with respect to the Clifford gate set, the standard gate set of Clifford+T restricted to $\\le 2$ qubits, and the computationally universal Gaussian Clifford+T gate set.",

Recent works focus on limited-query budget settings and adopt random sampling or active learning-based sampling strategies on publicly available, unannotated data sources. However, these methods often result in selected queries that lack task relevance and data diversity, leading to limited success in achieving satisfactory results with low query costs. In this paper, we propose MeaeQ (Model extraction attack with efficient Queries), a straightforward yet effective method to address these issues. Specifically, we initially utilize a zero-shot sequence inference classifier, combined with API service information, to filter task-relevant data from a public text corpus instead of a problem domain-specific dataset. Furthermore, we employ a clustering-based data reduction technique to obtain representative data as queries for the attack. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MeaeQ achieves higher functional similarity to the victim model than baselines while requiring fewer queries.

Traditional machine translation relies on parallel corpora for supervised translation, which is not feasible for program translation due to a dearth of aligned data. Recent unsupervised neural machine translation techniques have overcome data limitations by included techniques such as back translation and low level compiler intermediate representations (IR). These methods face significant challenges due to the noise in code snippet alignment and the diversity of IRs respectively. In this paper we propose a novel model called Code Distillation (CoDist) whereby we capture the semantic and structural equivalence of code in a language agnostic intermediate representation. Distilled code serves as a translation pivot for any programming language, leading by construction to parallel corpora which scale to all available source code by simply applying the distillation compiler. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on CodeXGLUE and TransCoder GeeksForGeeks translation benchmarks, with an average absolute increase of 12.7% on the TransCoder GeeksforGeeks translation benchmark compare to TransCoder-ST.",

This over-simplified setting falls short of representing the real-world software development scenario where repositories span multiple files with numerous cross-file dependencies, and accessing and understanding cross-file context is often required to complete the code correctly.\n  To fill in this gap, we propose CrossCodeEval, a diverse and multilingual code completion benchmark that necessitates an in-depth cross-file contextual understanding to complete the code accurately. CrossCodeEval is built on a diverse set of real-world, open-sourced, permissively-licensed repositories in four popular programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, and C#. To create examples that strictly require cross-file context for accurate completion, we propose a straightforward yet efficient static-analysis-based approach to pinpoint the use of cross-file context within the current file.\n  Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art code language models like CodeGen and StarCoder demonstrate that CrossCodeEval is extremely challenging when the relevant cross-file context is absent, and we see clear improvements when adding these context into the prompt. However, despite such improvements, the pinnacle of performance remains notably unattained even with the highest-performing model, indicating that CrossCodeEval is also capable of assessing model's capability in leveraging extensive context to make better code completion. Finally, we benchmarked various methods in retrieving cross-file context, and show that CrossCodeEval can also be used to measure the capability of code retrievers.",

We represent problems in a space of LLM-generated semantic descriptors describing the programming skills required to solve them (e.g. string manipulation, dynamic programming, etc.) and measure their difficulty empirically as a linearly decreasing function of the success rate of Llama-3-70B, a state-of-the-art LLM problem solver. ACES iteratively prompts a large language model to generate difficult problems achieving a diversity of target semantic descriptors (goal-directed exploration) using previously generated problems as in-context examples. ACES generates problems that are more diverse and more challenging than problems produced by baseline methods and three times more challenging than problems found in existing Python programming benchmarks on average across 11 state-of-the-art code LLMs.",

While previous research has mainly focused on sentence-level relation extraction, recent studies have expanded the scope to document-level relation extraction. Traditional relation extraction methods heavily rely on human-annotated training data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To mitigate the need for manual annotation, recent weakly-supervised approaches have been developed for sentence-level relation extraction while limited work has been done on document-level relation extraction. Weakly-supervised document-level relation extraction faces significant challenges due to an imbalanced number \"no relation\" instances and the failure of directly probing pretrained large language models for document relation extraction. To address these challenges, we propose PromptRE, a novel weakly-supervised document-level relation extraction method that combines prompting-based techniques with data programming. Furthermore, PromptRE incorporates the label distribution and entity types as prior knowledge to improve the performance. By leveraging the strengths of both prompting and data programming, PromptRE achieves improved performance in relation classification and effectively handles the \"no relation\" problem. Experimental results on ReDocRED, a benchmark dataset for document-level relation extraction, demonstrate the superiority of PromptRE over baseline approaches.",

For example, ChatGPT, the latest black-box LLM, has been investigated by numerous recent research studies and has shown impressive performance in various tasks. However, there exists a potential risk of data leakage since these LLMs are usually close-sourced with unknown specific training details, e.g., pre-training datasets.\n  In this paper, we seek to review the bug-fixing capabilities of ChatGPT on a clean APR benchmark with different research objectives. We first introduce {\\benchmark}, a new benchmark with buggy and the corresponding fixed programs from competitive programming problems starting from 2023, after the training cutoff point of ChatGPT. The results on {\\benchmark} show that ChatGPT is able to fix 109 out of 151 buggy programs using the basic prompt within 35 independent rounds, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs CodeT5 and PLBART by 27.5\\% and 62.4\\% prediction accuracy. We also investigate the impact of three types of prompts, i.e., problem description, error feedback, and bug localization, leading to additional 34 fixed bugs. Besides, we provide additional discussion from the interactive nature of ChatGPT to illustrate the capacity of a dialog-based repair workflow with 9 additional fixed bugs. Inspired by the findings, we further pinpoint various challenges and opportunities for advanced SE study equipped with such LLMs (e.g.,~ChatGPT) in the near future. More importantly, our work calls for more research on the reevaluation of the achievements obtained by existing black-box LLMs across various SE tasks, not limited to ChatGPT on APR.",

To address this gap, we adopted an iterative design process to gain insights into programmers' strategies when using LLMs for programming. Building on our findings, we created CoLadder, a system that supports programmers by facilitating hierarchical task decomposition, direct code segment manipulation, and result evaluation during prompt authoring. A user study with 12 experienced programmers showed that CoLadder is effective in helping programmers externalize their problem-solving intentions flexibly, improving their ability to evaluate and modify code across various abstraction levels, from goal to final code implementation.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, contrastive learning has become a key component in fine-tuning code search models for software development efficiency and effectiveness. It pulls together positive code snippets while pushing negative samples away given search queries. Among contrastive learning, InfoNCE is the most widely used loss function due to its better performance. However, the following problems in negative samples of InfoNCE may deteriorate its representation learning: 1) The existence of false negative samples in large code corpora due to duplications. 2). The failure to explicitly differentiate between the potential relevance of negative samples. As an example, a bubble sorting algorithm example is less ``negative'' than a file saving function for the quick sorting algorithm query. In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing a simple yet effective Soft-InfoNCE loss that inserts weight terms into InfoNCE. In our proposed loss function, we apply three methods to estimate the weights of negative pairs and show that the vanilla InfoNCE loss is a special case of Soft-InfoNCE. Theoretically, we analyze the effects of Soft-InfoNCE on controlling the distribution of learnt code representations and on deducing a more precise mutual information estimation. We furthermore discuss the superiority of proposed loss functions with other design alternatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-InfoNCE and weights estimation methods under state-of-the-art code search models on a large-scale public dataset consisting of six programming languages.

        "Abstract": "We introduce Lemur and Lemur-Chat, openly accessible language models optimized for both natural language and coding capabilities to serve as the backbone of versatile language agents. The evolution from language chat models to functional language agents demands that models not only master human interaction, reasoning, and planning but also ensure grounding in the relevant environments. This calls for a harmonious blend of language and coding capabilities in the models. Lemur and Lemur-Chat are proposed to address this necessity, demonstrating balanced proficiencies in both domains, unlike existing open-source models that tend to specialize in either. Through meticulous pre-training using a code-intensive corpus and instruction fine-tuning on text and code data, our models achieve state-of-the-art averaged performance across diverse text and coding benchmarks among open-source models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Lemur's superiority over existing open-source models and its proficiency across various agent tasks involving human communication, tool usage, and interaction under fully- and partially- observable environments. The harmonization between natural and programming languages enables Lemur-Chat to significantly narrow the gap with proprietary models on agent abilities, providing key insights into developing advanced open-source agents adept at reasoning, planning, and operating seamlessly across environments. https://github.com/OpenLemur/Lemur",

        "Abstract": "Large language models offer new ways of empowering people to program robot applications-namely, code generation via prompting. However, the code generated by LLMs is susceptible to errors. This work reports a preliminary exploration that empirically characterizes common errors produced by LLMs in robot programming. We categorize these errors into two phases: interpretation and execution. In this work, we focus on errors in execution and observe that they are caused by LLMs being \"forgetful\" of key information provided in user prompts. Based on this observation, we propose prompt engineering tactics designed to reduce errors in execution. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of these tactics with three language models: ChatGPT, Bard, and LLaMA-2. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from using LLMs in robot programming and call for the benchmarking of LLM-powered end-user development of robot applications.",

        "Abstract": "In the existing software development ecosystem, security issues introduced by third-party code cannot be overlooked. Among these security concerns, memory access vulnerabilities stand out prominently, leading to risks such as the theft or tampering of sensitive data. To address this issue, software-based defense mechanisms have been established at the programming language, compiler, and operating system levels. However, as a trade-off, these mechanisms significantly reduce software execution efficiency. Hardware-software co-design approaches have sought to either construct entirely isolated trusted execution environments or attempt to partition security domains within the same address space. While such approaches enhance efficiency compared to pure software methods, they also encounter challenges related to granularity of protection, performance overhead, and portability. In response to these challenges, we present the DASICS (Dynamic in-Address-Space Isolation by Code Segments) secure processor design, which offers dynamic and flexible security protection across multiple privilege levels, addressing data flow protection, control flow protection, and secure system calls. We have implemented hardware FPGA prototypes and software QEMU simulator prototypes based on DASICS, along with necessary modifications to system software for adaptability. We illustrate the protective mechanisms and effectiveness of DASICS with two practical examples and provide potential real-world use cases where DASICS could be applied.",

However, the effectiveness of existing models in understanding non-English inputs for multi-lingual code-related tasks is still far from well studied. This paper introduces CodeFuse-13B, an open-sourced pre-trained code LLM. It is specifically designed for code-related tasks with both English and Chinese prompts and supports over 40 programming languages. CodeFuse achieves its effectiveness by utilizing a high quality pre-training dataset that is carefully filtered by program analyzers and optimized during the training process. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world usage scenarios, the industry-standard benchmark HumanEval-x, and the specially designed CodeFuseEval for Chinese prompts. To assess the effectiveness of CodeFuse, we actively collected valuable human feedback from the AntGroup's software development process where CodeFuse has been successfully deployed. The results demonstrate that CodeFuse-13B achieves a HumanEval pass@1 score of 37.10%, positioning it as one of the top multi-lingual code LLMs with similar parameter sizes. In practical scenarios, such as code generation, code translation, code comments, and testcase generation, CodeFuse performs better than other models when confronted with Chinese prompts.",

The goal of this work is to automatically generate tests and use these tests to validate and verify compiler implementations of a directive-based parallel programming paradigm, OpenACC. To do so, in this paper, we explore the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including open-source LLMs -- Meta Codellama, Phind fine-tuned version of Codellama, Deepseek Deepseek Coder and closed-source LLMs -- OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo. We further fine-tuned the open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5-Turbo using our own testsuite dataset along with using the OpenACC specification. We also explored these LLMs using various prompt engineering techniques that include code template, template with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), one-shot example, one-shot with RAG, expressive prompt with code template and RAG. This paper highlights our findings from over 5000 tests generated via all the above mentioned methods. Our contributions include: (a) exploring the capabilities of the latest and relevant LLMs for code generation, (b) investigating fine-tuning and prompt methods, and (c) analyzing the outcome of LLMs generated tests including manually analysis of representative set of tests. We found the LLM Deepseek-Coder-33b-Instruct produced the most passing tests followed by GPT-4-Turbo.",

        "Abstract": "MLIR is an emerging compiler infrastructure for modern hardware, but existing programs cannot take advantage of MLIR's high-performance compilation if they are described in lower-level general purpose languages. Consequently, to avoid programs needing to be rewritten manually, this has led to efforts to automatically raise lower-level to higher-level dialects in MLIR. However, current methods rely on manually-defined raising rules, which limit their applicability and make them challenging to maintain as MLIR dialects evolve.\n  We present mlirSynth -- a novel approach which translates programs from lower-level MLIR dialects to high-level ones without manually defined rules. Instead, it uses available dialect definitions to construct a program space and searches it effectively using type constraints and equivalences. We demonstrate its effectiveness \\revi{by raising C programs} to two distinct high-level MLIR dialects, which enables us to use existing high-level dialect specific compilation flows. On Polybench, we show a greater coverage than previous approaches, resulting in geomean speedups of 2.5x (Intel) and 3.4x (AMD) over state-of-the-art compilation flows for the C programming language. mlirSynth also enables retargetability to domain-specific accelerators, resulting in a geomean speedup of 21.6x on a TPU.",

        "Abstract": "Interactive proof assistants are computer programs carefully constructed to check a human-designed proof of a mathematical claim with high confidence in the implementation. However, this only validates truth of a formal claim, which may have been mistranslated from a claim made in natural language. This is especially problematic when using proof assistants to formally verify the correctness of software with respect to a natural language specification. The translation from informal to formal remains a challenging, time-consuming process that is difficult to audit for correctness.\n  This paper shows that it is possible to build support for specifications written in expressive subsets of natural language, within existing proof assistants, consistent with the principles used to establish trust and auditability in proof assistants themselves. We implement a means to provide specifications in a modularly extensible formal subset of English, and have them automatically translated into formal claims, entirely within the Lean proof assistant. Our approach is extensible (placing no permanent restrictions on grammatical structure), modular (allowing information about new words to be distributed alongside libraries), and produces proof certificates explaining how each word was interpreted and how the sentence's structure was used to compute the meaning.\n  We apply our prototype to the translation of various English descriptions of formal specifications from a popular textbook into Lean formalizations; all can be translated correctly with a modest lexicon with only minor modifications related to lexicon size.",

We investigate the role of generative AI models in providing human tutor-style programming hints to help students resolve errors in their buggy programs. Recent works have benchmarked state-of-the-art models for various feedback generation scenarios; however, their overall quality is still inferior to human tutors and not yet ready for real-world deployment. In this paper, we seek to push the limits of generative AI models toward providing high-quality programming hints and develop a novel technique, GPT4Hints-GPT3.5Val. As a first step, our technique leverages GPT-4 as a ``tutor'' model to generate hints -- it boosts the generative quality by using symbolic information of failing test cases and fixes in prompts. As a next step, our technique leverages GPT-3.5, a weaker model, as a ``student'' model to further validate the hint quality -- it performs an automatic quality validation by simulating the potential utility of providing this feedback. We show the efficacy of our technique via extensive evaluation using three real-world datasets of Python programs covering a variety of concepts ranging from basic algorithms to regular expressions and data analysis using pandas library.",

        "Abstract": "The ML community is rapidly exploring techniques for prompting language models (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks. Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded \"prompt templates\", i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transformation graphs, i.e. imperative computational graphs where LMs are invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn (by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and llama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting (generally by over 25% and 65%, respectively) and pipelines with expert-created demonstrations (by up to 5-46% and 16-40%, respectively). On top of that, DSPy programs compiled to open and relatively small LMs like 770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written prompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5.

We present ORTAC+, a language and a planning tool designed for this end-user. Its main objective is to allow a natural modeling of the mission, to minimize the risk of bad modeling, and thus obtain reliable plans. The language offers high-level constructs specifically designed to describe tactical missions, but at the same time has clear semantics allowing a translation to PDDL, to take advantage of state-of-the-art planners.",

Still, as LLMs (and other generative models) generate more complex output, such as summaries, tables, or code, it becomes harder for the user to audit or evaluate the output for quality or correctness. Hence, we are seeing the emergence of tool-assisted experiences to help the user double-check a piece of AI-generated content. We refer to these as co-audit tools. Co-audit tools complement prompt engineering techniques: one helps the user construct the input prompt, while the other helps them check the output response. As a specific example, this paper describes recent research on co-audit tools for spreadsheet computations powered by generative models. We explain why co-audit experiences are essential for any application of generative AI where quality is important and errors are consequential (as is common in spreadsheet computations). We propose a preliminary list of principles for co-audit, and outline research challenges.",

CGS are input using our modelling language LCGS, where composition and synchronisation are easily described. We prove the correctness of our encoding, and our experiments show that our tool CGAAL is often one to three orders of magnitude faster than the popular tool PRISM-games on case studies from PRISM's documentation and among case studies we have developed.

In programming courses, immediate, automated feedback is typically provided in the form of pre-defined test cases run by a submission platform. While these are excellent for highlighting the presence of logical errors, they do not provide novice programmers enough scaffolding to help them identify where an error is or how to fix it. To address this, several tools have been developed that provide richer feedback in the form of program repairs. Studies of such tools, however, tend to focus more on whether correct repairs can be generated, rather than how novices are using them. In this paper, we describe our experience of using CLARA, an automated repair tool, to provide feedback to novices. First, we extended CLARA to support a larger subset of the Python language, before integrating it with the Jupyter Notebooks used for our programming exercises. Second, we devised a preliminary study in which students tackled programming problems with and without support of the tool using the 'think aloud' protocol. We found that novices often struggled to understand the proposed repairs, echoing the well-known challenge to understand compiler/interpreter messages. Furthermore, we found that students valued being told where a fix was needed - without necessarily the fix itself - suggesting that 'less may be more' from a pedagogical perspective.",

We believe that CHERI could provide significant security guarantees for high-end dynamic MMU-less embedded systems at lower costs, compared to MMUs and MPUs, by: 1) building the entire software stack in pure-capability CHERI C mode which provides complete spatial memory safety at the kernel and user-level, 2) isolating user programs as separate ELFs, each with its own CHERI-based capability table; this provides spatial memory safety similar to what the MMU offers (\\ie user programs cannot access each other's memory), 3) isolating user programs from the kernel as the kernel has its own capability table from the users and vice versa, and 4) compartmentalising kernel modules using CompartOS' linkage-based compartmentalisation. This offers a new security front that is not possible using the current MMU-based Linux, where vulnerable/malicious kernel modules (\\eg device drivers) executing in the kernel space would not compromise or take down the entire system. These are the four main contributions of this paper, presenting novel CHERI-based mechanisms to secure MMU-less embedded Linux.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs), especially those that are pretrained on code, have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating programs from natural language inputs in a few-shot or even zero-shot manner. Despite promising results, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive evaluation of these models language-to-code generation capabilities. Existing studies often focus on specific tasks, model architectures, or learning paradigms, leading to a fragmented understanding of the overall landscape. In this work, we present L2CEval, a systematic evaluation of the language-to-code generation capabilities of LLMs on 7 tasks across the domain spectrum of semantic parsing, math reasoning and Python programming, analyzing the factors that potentially affect their performance, such as model size, pretraining data, instruction tuning, and different prompting methods. In addition to assessing model performance, we measure confidence calibration for the models and conduct human evaluations of the output programs. This enables us to identify and analyze the typical failure modes across various tasks and models. L2CEval offers a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in language-to-code generation. We also release the evaluation framework and all model outputs, hoping to lay the groundwork for further future research in this domain.",

This is the Language-Models-as-a-Service (LMaaS) paradigm. In contrast with scenarios where full model access is available, as in the case of open-source models, such closed-off language models present specific challenges for evaluating, benchmarking, and testing them. This paper has two goals: on the one hand, we delineate how the aforementioned challenges act as impediments to the accessibility, replicability, reliability, and trustworthiness of LMaaS. We systematically examine the issues that arise from a lack of information about language models for each of these four aspects. We conduct a detailed analysis of existing solutions and put forth a number of considered recommendations, and highlight the directions for future advancements. On the other hand, it serves as a comprehensive resource for existing knowledge on current, major LMaaS, offering a synthesized overview of the licences and capabilities their interfaces offer.",

Although they can be very different, these languages show two common features: they emphasize (a) variability, and (b) the specification of constraints to define acceptable configurations. It is now widely acknowledged that configuring a product can be considered as a constraint satisfaction problem. It is thus natural to consider constraint programming as a first choice candidate to specify constraints on PL. For instance, the different constraints that can be specified using the FODA language can easily be expressed using boolean constraints, which enables automated calculation and configuration using a SAT solver. But constraint programming proposes other domains than the boolean domain: for instance integers, real, or sets. The integer domain was, for instance, proposed by Benavides to specify constraints on feature attributes. This paper proposes to further explore the use of integer constraint programming to specify PL constraints. The approach was implemented in a prototype tool. Its use in a real case showed that constraint programming encompasses different PL modeling languages (such as FORE, OVM, or else), and allows specifying complex constraints that are difficult to specify with these languages.",

However, most existing methods either target a single language or require high computational resources to train multilingual models. In this paper, we propose T5APR, a novel neural program repair approach that provides a unified solution for bug fixing across multiple programming languages. T5APR leverages CodeT5, a powerful pre-trained text-to-text transformer model, and adopts a checkpoint ensemble strategy to improve patch recommendation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on six well-known benchmarks in four programming languages (Java, Python, C, JavaScript), demonstrating T5APR's competitiveness against state-of-the-art techniques. T5APR correctly fixes 1,985 bugs, including 1,442 bugs that none of the compared techniques has fixed. We further support the effectiveness of our approach by conducting detailed analyses, such as comparing the correct patch ranking among different techniques. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of T5APR for use in real-world applications and highlight the importance of multilingual approaches in the field of APR.",

        "Abstract": "Code is increasingly becoming a core data modality of modern machine learning research impacting not only the way we write code with conversational agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, or Anthropic's Claude, the way we translate code from one language into another, but also the compiler infrastructure underlying the language. While modeling approaches may vary and representations differ, the targeted tasks often remain the same within the individual classes of models. Relying solely on the ability of modern models to extract information from unstructured code does not take advantage of 70 years of programming language and compiler development by not utilizing the structure inherent to programs in the data collection. This detracts from the performance of models working over a tokenized representation of input code and precludes the use of these models in the compiler itself. To work towards the first intermediate representation (IR) based models, we fully utilize the LLVM compiler infrastructure, shared by a number of languages, to generate a 182B token dataset of LLVM IR. We generated this dataset from programming languages built on the shared LLVM infrastructure, including Rust, Swift, Julia, and C/C++, by hooking into LLVM code generation either through the language's package manager or the compiler directly to extract the dataset of intermediate representations from production grade programs. Statistical analysis proves the utility of our dataset not only for large language model training, but also for the introspection into the code generation process itself with the dataset showing great promise for machine-learned compiler components.",

We propose a novel redefinition of the compilation process in terms of interpreting the program definition as a script. This evaluation is performed in an environment where the full compilation pipeline is implemented and exposed to the user via a meta-object protocol, which forms the basis for a meta-circular definition and implementation of the programming language itself.

Most programming languages have native support for defining data types and functions in a way that supports either (1) or (2), but not both. This lack of native support makes it difficult to use and extend libraries. A theoretically well-studied solution is to define data types and functions using initial algebra semantics. While it is possible to encode this solution in existing programming languages, such encodings add syntactic and interpretive overhead, and commonly fail to take advantage of the map and fold fusion laws of initial algebras which compilers could exploit to generate more efficient code. A solution to these is to provide native support for initial algebra semantics. In this paper, we develop such a solution and present a type discipline and core calculus for a language with native support for initial algebra semantics.",

        "Abstract": "Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering hours. Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code. Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods. Guess & Sketch extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output. We test Guess & Sketch on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler. We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task.",

This technique is especially relevant when leveraging (weak) higher-order abstract syntax to handle channel mobility and the intricate binding structures that arise in session-typed systems. Following this approach, we mechanize a session-typed system based on classical linear logic and its type preservation proof in the proof assistant Beluga, which uses the logical framework LF as its encoding language. We also prove adequacy for our encoding. This shows the tractability and effectiveness of our approach in modelling substructural systems such as session-typed languages.",

A superpositioner is a model formed by several Boolean functions that their variables and function values are feeding back to each other. The component of the superpositioner is the reentry function, which can be fully described by classical logic and can be calculated by classical computation, but the superpositioner as a whole is a non-logical entity, and it is impossible for classical computation to fully compute it. In this article, we present the concept of a superpositioner and discuss its basic properties. We find that the superpositioner + dispositioner will form a new type of computation model whose capabilities can surpass Turing computation. We envision that this new model will help implement these functions in the intelligent agent: a whole new way of programming and a whole new way of learning, endogenous feelings, analogies and associations, forming understanding, dynamic action, participating in the formation of subjectivity, and more. We will also discuss how to implement superpositioner in the most preliminary way.",

However, vulnerabilities in software still pose a significant threat, as they can have serious consequences. Recent advances in automated program repair have sought to automatically detect and fix bugs using data-driven techniques. Sophisticated deep learning methods have been applied to this area and have achieved promising results. However, existing benchmarks for training and evaluating these techniques remain limited, as they tend to focus on a single programming language and have relatively small datasets. Moreover, many benchmarks tend to be outdated and lack diversity, focusing on a specific codebase. Worse still, the quality of bug explanations in existing datasets is low, as they typically use imprecise and uninformative commit messages as explanations.\n  To address these issues, we propose an automated collecting framework REEF to collect REal-world vulnErabilities and Fixes from open-source repositories. We develop a multi-language crawler to collect vulnerabilities and their fixes, and design metrics to filter for high-quality vulnerability-fix pairs. Furthermore, we propose a neural language model-based approach to generate high-quality vulnerability explanations, which is key to producing informative fix messages. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach can collect high-quality vulnerability-fix pairs and generate strong explanations. The dataset we collect contains 4,466 CVEs with 30,987 patches (including 236 CWE) across 7 programming languages with detailed related information, which is superior to existing benchmarks in scale, coverage, and quality. Evaluations by human experts further confirm that our framework produces high-quality vulnerability explanations.",

Our infrastructure can be viewed as the probabilistic analogue of Boogie: its central components are an intermediate verification language (IVL) together with a real-valued logic. Our IVL provides a programming-language-style for expressing verification conditions whose validity implies the correctness of a program under investigation. As our focus is on verifying quantitative properties such as bounds on expected outcomes, expected run-times, or termination probabilities, off-the-shelf IVLs based on Boolean first-order logic do not suffice. Instead, a paradigm shift from the standard Boolean to a real-valued domain is required.\n  Our IVL features quantitative generalizations of standard verification constructs such as assume- and assert-statements. Verification conditions are generated by a weakest-precondition-style semantics, based on our real-valued logic. We show that our verification infrastructure supports natural encodings of numerous verification techniques from the literature. With our SMT-based implementation, we automatically verify a variety of benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this establishes the first deductive verification infrastructure for expectation-based reasoning about probabilistic programs.",

Due to the hardness of manipulating the programming languages of data visualization, automatic data visualization generation from natural languages (Text-to-Vis) is becoming increasingly popular. Despite the plethora of research effort on the English Text-to-Vis, studies have yet to be conducted on data visualization generation from questions in Chinese. Motivated by this, we propose a Chinese Text-to-Vis dataset in the paper and demonstrate our first attempt to tackle this problem. Our model integrates multilingual BERT as the encoder, boosts the cross-lingual ability, and infuses the $n$-gram information into our word representation learning. Our experimental results show that our dataset is challenging and deserves further research.",

Yet, its swiftly expanding ecosystem lacks robust software diversification systems. We introduce WASM-MUTATE, a diversification engine specifically designed for WebAssembly. Our engine meets several essential criteria: 1) To quickly generate functionally identical, yet behaviorally diverse, WebAssembly variants, 2) To be universally applicable to any WebAssembly program, irrespective of the source programming language, and 3) Generated variants should counter side-channels. By leveraging an e-graph data structure, WASM-MUTATE is implemented to meet both speed and efficacy. We evaluate WASM-MUTATE by conducting experiments on 404 programs, which include real-world applications. Our results highlight that WASM-MUTATE can produce tens of thousands of unique and efficient WebAssembly variants within minutes. Significantly, WASM-MUTATE can safeguard WebAssembly binaries against timing side-channel attacks,especially those of the Spectre type.",

OpenAI's GPT model has potential in such clone generation as GPT is used for text generation. When developers copy/paste codes from Stack Overflow (SO) or within a system, there might be inconsistent changes leading to unexpected behaviours. Similarly, if someone possesses a code snippet in a particular programming language but seeks equivalent functionality in a different language, a semantic cross-language code clone generation approach could provide valuable assistance. In this study, using SemanticCloneBench as a vehicle, we evaluated how well the GPT-3 model could help generate semantic and cross-language clone variants for a given fragment.We have comprised a diverse set of code fragments and assessed GPT-3s performance in generating code variants.Through extensive experimentation and analysis, where 9 judges spent 158 hours to validate, we investigate the model's ability to produce accurate and semantically correct variants. Our findings shed light on GPT-3's strengths in code generation, offering insights into the potential applications and challenges of using advanced language models in software development. Our quantitative analysis yields compelling results. In the realm of semantic clones, GPT-3 attains an impressive accuracy of 62.14% and 0.55 BLEU score, achieved through few-shot prompt engineering. Furthermore, the model shines in transcending linguistic confines, boasting an exceptional 91.25% accuracy in generating cross-language clones",

        "Abstract": "Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to reduce manual debugging efforts for developers and improve software reliability. While conventional search-based techniques typically rely on heuristic rules or a redundancy assumption to mine fix patterns, recent years have witnessed the surge of deep learning (DL) based approaches to automate the program repair process in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is often limited by a fixed set of parameters to model the highly complex search space of APR. To ease such burden on the parametric models, in this work, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Patch Generation framework (RAP-Gen) by explicitly leveraging relevant fix patterns retrieved from a codebase of previous bug-fix pairs. Specifically, we build a hybrid patch retriever to account for both lexical and semantic matching based on the raw source code in a language-agnostic manner, which does not rely on any code-specific features. In addition, we adapt a code-aware language model CodeT5 as our foundation model to facilitate both patch retrieval and generation tasks in a unified manner. We adopt a stage-wise approach where the patch retriever first retrieves a relevant external bug-fix pair to augment the buggy input for the CodeT5 patch generator, which synthesizes a ranked list of repair patch candidates. Notably, RAP-Gen is a generic APR framework that can flexibly integrate different patch retrievers and generators to repair various types of bugs. We thoroughly evaluate RAP-Gen on three benchmarks in two programming languages, including the TFix benchmark in JavaScript, and Code Refinement and Defects4J benchmarks in Java, where the bug localization information may or may not be provided. Experimental results show that RAP-Gen significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on all benchmarks, e.g., repairing 15 more bugs on 818 Defects4J bugs.",

We propose Latte, a new approach that aims to minimize both the amount of annotations and the complexity of invariants necessary for reasoning about aliasing in an object-oriented language with mutation. Our approach only requires annotations for parameters and fields, while annotations for local variables are inferred. Furthermore, it relaxes uniqueness to allow aliasing among local variables, as long as this aliasing can be precisely determined. This enables support for destructive reads without changes to the language or its run-time semantics. Despite this simplicity, we show how this design can still be used for tracking uniqueness and aliasing in a local sequential setting, with practical applications, such as modeling a stack.",

Originally designed to solve privacy issues, ZKPs have now evolved into an effective remedy for scalability concerns and are applied in Zcash (internet money like Bitcoin). To enable ZKPs, Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS) offer a verifier for bi-linear equations. To accurately and efficiently represent R1CS, several language tools like Circom, Noir, and Snarky have been proposed to automate the compilation of advanced programs into R1CS. However, due to the flexible nature of R1CS representation, there can be significant differences in the compiled R1CS forms generated from circuit language programs with the same underlying semantics. To address this issue, this paper uses a data-flow-based R1CS paradigm algorithm, which produces a standardized format for different R1CS instances with identical semantics. By using the normalized R1CS format circuits, the complexity of circuits' verification can be reduced. In addition, this paper presents an R1CS normalization algorithm benchmark, and our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of our methods.",

Hybrid quantum-HPC applications should be scalable, executable on Quantum Error Corrected (QEC) devices, and could use quantum-classical primitives. However, the lack of scalability, poor performances, and inability to insert classical schemes within quantum applications has prevented current quantum frameworks from being adopted by the HPC community.\n  This paper specifies the requirements of a hybrid quantum-classical framework compatible with HPC environments, and introduces a novel hardware-agnostic framework called Q-Pragma.

        "Abstract": "During Automated Program Repair (APR), it can be challenging to synthesize correct patches for real-world systems in general-purpose programming languages. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be helpful \"copilots\" in assisting developers with various coding tasks, and have also been directly applied for patch synthesis. However, most LLMs treat programs as sequences of tokens, meaning that they are ignorant of the underlying semantics constraints of the target programming language. This results in plenty of statically invalid generated patches, impeding the practicality of the technique. Therefore, we propose Repilot, a general code generation framework to further copilot the AI \"copilots\" (i.e., LLMs) by synthesizing more valid patches during the repair process. Our key insight is that many LLMs produce outputs autoregressively (i.e., token by token), resembling human writing programs, which can be significantly boosted and guided through a Completion Engine. Repilot synergistically synthesizes a candidate patch through the interaction between an LLM and a Completion Engine, which 1) prunes away infeasible tokens suggested by the LLM and 2) proactively completes the token based on the suggestions provided by the Completion Engine. Our evaluation on a subset of the widely-used Defects4j 1.2 and 2.0 datasets shows that Repilot outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by fixing 27% and 47% more bugs, respectively. Moreover, Repilot produces more valid and correct patches than the base LLM with the same budget. While we focus on leveraging Repilot for APR in this work, the overall approach is also generalizable to other code generation tasks.",

The results show that in certain circumstances, ChatGPT can produce correct spreadsheet formulae with correct reasoning, deduction and inference.

Yeast has 159 genes that encode protein kinases and phosphatases, and 136 of these have counterparts in humans. Therefore any insight in this model organism could potentially offer indications of mechanisms of action in the human kinome. The study utilises a Prolog-based approach, data from a yeast kinase deletions strains study and publicly available kinase-protein associations. Prolog, a programming language that is well-suited for symbolic reasoning is used to reason over the data and infer compensatory kinase networks. This approach is based on the idea that when a kinase is knocked out, other kinases may compensate for this loss of activity. Background knowledge on kinases targeting proteins is used to guide the analysis. This knowledge is used to infer the potential compensatory interactions between kinases based on the changes in phosphorylation observed in the phosphoproteomics data from the yeast study. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Prolog-based approach in analysing complex cell signalling mechanisms in yeast. The inferred compensatory kinase networks provide new insights into the regulation of cell signalling in yeast and may aid in the identification of potential therapeutic targets for modulating signalling pathways in yeast and other organisms.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce Jais and Jais-chat, new state-of-the-art Arabic-centric foundation and instruction-tuned open generative large language models (LLMs). The models are based on the GPT-3 decoder-only architecture and are pretrained on a mixture of Arabic and English texts, including source code in various programming languages. With 13 billion parameters, they demonstrate better knowledge and reasoning capabilities in Arabic than any existing open Arabic and multilingual models by a sizable margin, based on extensive evaluation. Moreover, the models are competitive in English compared to English-centric open models of similar size, despite being trained on much less English data. We provide a detailed description of the training, the tuning, the safety alignment, and the evaluation of the models. We release two open versions of the model -- the foundation Jais model, and an instruction-tuned Jais-chat variant -- with the aim of promoting research on Arabic LLMs. Available at https://huggingface.co/inception-mbzuai/jais-13b-chat",

        "Abstract": "Python and Prolog express different programming paradigms, with different strengths.  Python is wildly popular because it is well-structured, easy to use, and mixes well with thousands of scientific and machine learning programs written in C.  Prolog's logic-based approach provides powerful reasoning capabilities, especially when combined with constraint evaluation, probabilistic reasoning, well-founded negation, and other advances. Both languages have commonalities as well: both are usually written in C, both are dynamically typed, and both use data structures based on a small number of recursive types.\n  This paper describes the design and implementation of Janus, a system that tightly combines Prolog and Python into a single process. Janus bi-translates data structures and offers performance of many hundreds of thousands of round-trip inter-language calls per second. Although Janus is still new, it has been used in commercial applications including natural language processing, visual query answering and robotic automation.  Janus was developed for XSB, but porting Janus code to a second Prolog has been straightforward, indicating that Janus is a tool that other Prologs may easily adopt.",

        "Abstract": "With the emergence of Machine Learning, there has been a surge in leveraging its capabilities for problem-solving across various domains. In the code clone realm, the identification of type-4 or semantic clones has emerged as a crucial yet challenging task. Researchers aim to utilize Machine Learning to tackle this challenge, often relying on the BigCloneBench dataset. However, it's worth noting that BigCloneBench, originally not designed for semantic clone detection, presents several limitations that hinder its suitability as a comprehensive training dataset for this specific purpose. Furthermore, CLCDSA dataset suffers from a lack of reusable examples aligning with real-world software systems, rendering it inadequate for cross-language clone detection approaches. In this work, we present a comprehensive semantic clone and cross-language clone benchmark, GPTCloneBench by exploiting SemanticCloneBench and OpenAI's GPT-3 model. In particular, using code fragments from SemanticCloneBench as sample inputs along with appropriate prompt engineering for GPT-3 model, we generate semantic and cross-language clones for these specific fragments and then conduct a combination of extensive manual analysis, tool-assisted filtering, functionality testing and automated validation in building the benchmark. From 79,928 clone pairs of GPT-3 output, we created a benchmark with 37,149 true semantic clone pairs, 19,288 false semantic pairs(Type-1/Type-2), and 20,770 cross-language clones across four languages (Java, C, C#, and Python). Our benchmark is 15-fold larger than SemanticCloneBench, has more functional code examples for software systems and programming language support than CLCDSA, and overcomes BigCloneBench's qualities, quantification, and language variety limitations.",

Programmer attention refers to what information people intake when performing programming tasks. Models of programmer attention refer to machine prediction of what information is important to people. Models of programmer attention are important because they help researchers build better interfaces, assistive technologies, and more human-like AI. For many years, researchers in SE have built these models based on features such as mouse clicks, key logging, and IDE interactions. Yet the holy grail in this area is scanpath prediction -- the prediction of the sequence of eye fixations a person would take over a visual stimulus. A person's eye movements are considered the most concrete evidence that a person is taking in a piece of information. Scanpath prediction is a notoriously difficult problem, but we believe that the emergence of lower-cost, higher-accuracy eye tracking equipment and better large language models of source code brings a solution within grasp. We present an eye tracking experiment with 27 programmers and a prototype scanpath predictor to present preliminary results and obtain early community feedback.",

        "Abstract": "Developers introduce code clones to improve programming productivity. Many existing studies have achieved impressive performance in monolingual code clone detection. However, during software development, more and more developers write semantically equivalent programs with different languages to support different platforms and help developers translate projects from one language to another. Considering that collecting cross-language parallel data, especially for low-resource languages, is expensive and time-consuming, how designing an effective cross-language model that does not rely on any parallel data is a significant problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named ZC3 for Zero-shot Cross-language Code Clone detection. ZC3 designs the contrastive snippet prediction to form an isomorphic representation space among different programming languages. Based on this, ZC3 exploits domain-aware learning and cycle consistency learning to further constrain the model to generate representations that are aligned among different languages meanwhile are diacritical for different types of clones. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four representative cross-language clone detection datasets. Experimental results show that ZC3 outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 67.12%, 51.39%, 14.85%, and 53.01% on the MAP score, respectively. We further investigate the representational distribution of different languages and discuss the effectiveness of our method.",

In this study, we evaluate the similarity of programming languages by analyzing their representations using a CodeBERT-based model. Our experiments reveal that token representation in languages such as C++, Python, and Java exhibit proximity to one another, whereas the same tokens in languages such as Mathematica and R display significant dissimilarity. Our findings suggest that this phenomenon can potentially result in performance challenges when dealing with diverse languages. Thus, we recommend using our similarity measure to select a diverse set of programming languages when training and evaluating future models.",

        "Abstract": "Code generation systems have been extensively developed in recent years to generate source code based on natural language instructions. However, despite their advancements, these systems still face robustness issues where even slightly different instructions can result in significantly different code semantics. Robustness is critical for code generation systems, as it can have significant impacts on software development, software quality, and trust in the generated code. Although existing testing techniques for general text-to-text software can detect some robustness issues, they are limited in effectiveness due to ignoring the characteristics of code generation systems. In this work, we propose a novel technique COCO to test the robustness of code generation systems. It exploits the usage scenario of code generation systems to make the original programming instruction more concrete by incorporating features known to be contained in the original code. A robust system should maintain code semantics for the concretized instruction, and COCO detects robustness inconsistencies when it does not. We evaluated COCO on eight advanced code generation systems, including commercial tools such as Copilot and ChatGPT, using two widely-used datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of COCO in testing the robustness of code generation systems, outperforming two techniques adopted from general text-to-text software testing by 466.66% and 104.02%, respectively. Furthermore, concretized instructions generated by COCO can help reduce robustness inconsistencies by 18.35% to 53.91% through fine-tuning.",

However, whilst High Level Synthesis (HLS) has significantly lowered the barrier to entry in programming FPGAs by enabling programmers to use C++, a major challenge is that most often these codes are not originally written in C++. Instead, Fortran is the lingua franca of scientific computing and-so it requires a complex and time consuming initial step to convert into C++ even before considering the FPGA.\n  In this paper we describe work enabling Fortran for AMD Xilinx FPGAs by connecting the LLVM Flang front end to AMD Xilinx's LLVM back end. This enables programmers to use Fortran as a first-class language for programming FPGAs, and as we demonstrate enjoy all the tuning and optimisation opportunities that HLS C++ provides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that certain language features of Fortran make it especially beneficial for programming FPGAs compared to C++. The result of this work is a lowering of the barrier to entry in using FPGAs for scientific computing, enabling programmers to leverage their existing codebase and language of choice on the FPGA directly.",

We analysed a subset of these error/explanation pairs to evaluate their properties, including conceptual correctness, relevancy, and overall quality. We found that the LLM-generated explanations were conceptually accurate in 90% of compile-time and 75% of run-time cases, but often disregarded the instruction not to provide solutions in code.

Our approach employs linear programming techniques to derive rigorous bounds by leveraging two types of spectral identities. The first type, inspired by the conformal bootstrap, arises from the consistency of the spectral decomposition of the product of Laplace eigensections, and involves the Laplacian spectra as well as integrals of triple products of eigensections. We formulate these conditions in the language of representation theory of $\\mathrm{PSL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$ and use them to prove upper bounds on the first and second Laplacian eigenvalues. The second type of spectral identities follows from the Selberg trace formula. We use them to find upper bounds on the spectral gap of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on hyperbolic 3-orbifolds, as well as on the systole length of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, as a function of the volume. Further, we prove that the spectral gap $λ_1$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on all closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds satisfies $λ_1 < 47.32$. Along the way, we use the trace formula to estimate the low-energy spectra of a large set of example orbifolds and compare them with our general bounds, finding that the bounds are nearly sharp in several cases.",

        "Abstract": "To model the periodicity of beats, state-of-the-art beat tracking systems use \"post-processing trackers\" (PPTs) that rely on several empirically determined global assumptions for tempo transition, which work well for music with a steady tempo. For expressive classical music, however, these assumptions can be too rigid. With two large datasets of Western classical piano music, namely the Aligned Scores and Performances (ASAP) dataset and a dataset of Chopin's Mazurkas (Maz-5), we report on experiments showing the failure of existing PPTs to cope with local tempo changes, thus calling for new methods. In this paper, we propose a new local periodicity-based PPT, called predominant local pulse-based dynamic programming (PLPDP) tracking, that allows for more flexible tempo transitions. Specifically, the new PPT incorporates a method called \"predominant local pulses\" (PLP) in combination with a dynamic programming (DP) component to jointly consider the locally detected periodicity and beat activation strength at each time instant. Accordingly, PLPDP accounts for the local periodicity, rather than relying on a global tempo assumption. Compared to existing PPTs, PLPDP particularly enhances the recall values at the cost of a lower precision, resulting in an overall improvement of F1-score for beat tracking in ASAP (from 0.473 to 0.493) and Maz-5 (from 0.595 to 0.838).",

        "Abstract": "Over the past few years, Large Language Models of Code (Code LLMs) have started to have a significant impact on programming practice. Code LLMs are also emerging as building blocks for research in programming languages and software engineering. However, Code LLMs produce impressive results on programming languages that are well represented in their training data (e.g., Java, Python, or JavaScript), but struggle with low-resource languages that have limited training data available. Low resource languages include OCaml, Racket, and several others.\n  This paper presents an effective approach for boosting the performance of Code LLMs on low-resource languages using semi-synthetic data. Our approach, MultiPL-T, translates training data from high-resource languages into training data for low-resource languages in the following way. 1) We use a Code LLM to synthesize tests for commented code from a high-resource language, filtering out faulty tests and code with low test coverage. 2) We use a Code LLM to translate Python code to a target low-resource language, and use tests to validate the translation. We apply this approach to generate tens of thousands of validated training items for Julia, Lua, OCaml, R, and Racket. Furthermore, we use an open model (StarCoderBase) with open training data (The Stack), which allows us to decontaminate benchmarks, train models without violating licenses, and run experiments that could not otherwise be done.\n  With MultiPL-T generated data, we present fine-tuned versions of StarCoderBase and Code Llama for Julia, Lua, OCaml, R, and Racket. On established benchmarks (MultiPL-E), these models outperform other open Code LLMs. The MultiPL-T approach is easy to apply to new languages, and is significantly more efficient and effective than alternatives such as training longer.",

        "Abstract": "In high-performance computing (HPC), the demand for efficient parallel programming models has grown dramatically since the end of Dennard Scaling and the subsequent move to multi-core CPUs. OpenMP stands out as a popular choice due to its simplicity and portability, offering a directive-driven approach for shared-memory parallel programming. Despite its wide adoption, however, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the actual usage of OpenMP constructs, hindering unbiased insights into its popularity and evolution. This paper presents a statistical analysis of OpenMP usage and adoption trends based on a novel and extensive database, HPCORPUS, compiled from GitHub repositories containing C, C++, and Fortran code. The results reveal that OpenMP is the dominant parallel programming model, accounting for 45% of all analyzed parallel APIs. Furthermore, it has demonstrated steady and continuous growth in popularity over the past decade. Analyzing specific OpenMP constructs, the study provides in-depth insights into their usage patterns and preferences across the three languages. Notably, we found that while OpenMP has a strong \"common core\" of constructs in common usage (while the rest of the API is less used), there are new adoption trends as well, such as simd and target directives for accelerated computing and task for irregular parallelism. Overall, this study sheds light on OpenMP's significance in HPC applications and provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners. It showcases OpenMP's versatility, evolving adoption, and relevance in contemporary parallel programming, underlining its continued role in HPC applications and beyond. These statistical insights are essential for making informed decisions about parallelization strategies and provide a foundation for further advancements in parallel programming models and techniques.",

For such reason, it is a desired practice for the development of embedded software running in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). Unfortunately, state-of-the-art test data generation techniques for mutation testing of C and C++ software, two typical languages for CPS software, rely on symbolic execution, whose limitations often prevent its application (e.g., it cannot test black-box components).\n  We propose a mutation testing approach that leverages fuzz testing, which has proved effective with C and C++ software. Fuzz testing automatically generates diverse test inputs that exercise program branches in a varied number of ways and, therefore, exercise statements in different program states, thus maximizing the likelihood of killing mutants, our objective.\n  We performed an empirical assessment of our approach with software components used in satellite systems currently in orbit. Our empirical evaluation shows that mutation testing based on fuzz testing kills a significantly higher proportion of live mutants than symbolic execution (i.e., up to an additional 47 percentage points). Further, when symbolic execution cannot be applied, fuzz testing provides significant benefits (i.e., up to 41% mutants killed). Our study is the first one comparing fuzz testing and symbolic execution for mutation testing; our results provide guidance towards the development of fuzz testing tools dedicated to mutation testing.",

We observe that many of Arvada's generalization steps violate common language concept nesting rules. We thus propose to pre-structure input programs along these nesting rules, apply learnt rules recursively, and make black-box context-free grammar inference deterministic. The resulting TreeVada yielded faster runtime and higher-quality grammars in an empirical comparison.

While the previous CPROVER-based front-end served well for handling C++03 programs, it encountered challenges keeping up with the evolving C++ language. As new language and library features were added in each C++ version, the limitations of the old front-end became apparent, leading to difficult-to-maintain code. Consequently, modern C++ programs were challenging to verify. To overcome this obstacle, we redeveloped the front-end, opting for a more robust approach using clang. The new front-end efficiently traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in-memory using clang APIs and transforms each AST node into ESBMC's Intermediate Representation. Through extensive experimentation, our results demonstrate that ESBMC v7.3 with the new front-end significantly reduces parse and conversion errors, enabling successful verification of a wide range of C++ programs, thereby outperforming previous ESBMC versions.",

These unique Rust features also pose a steep learning curve for programmers.\n  This paper presents a tool called RustAssistant that leverages the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically suggest fixes for Rust compilation errors. RustAssistant uses a careful combination of prompting techniques as well as iteration with an LLM to deliver high accuracy of fixes. RustAssistant is able to achieve an impressive peak accuracy of roughly 74% on real-world compilation errors in popular open-source Rust repositories.

        "Abstract": "Fuzzing has achieved tremendous success in discovering bugs and vulnerabilities in various software systems. Systems under test (SUTs) that take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other languages or even other versions of the same language. Moreover, the inputs generated by existing fuzzers are often limited to specific features of the input language, and thus can hardly reveal bugs related to other or new features. This paper presents Fuzz4All, the first fuzzer that is universal in the sense that it can target many different input languages and many different features of these languages. The key idea behind Fuzz4All is to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an input generation and mutation engine, which enables the approach to produce diverse and realistic inputs for any practically relevant language. To realize this potential, we present a novel autoprompting technique, which creates LLM prompts that are wellsuited for fuzzing, and a novel LLM-powered fuzzing loop, which iteratively updates the prompt to create new fuzzing inputs. We evaluate Fuzz4All on nine systems under test that take in six different languages (C, C++, Go, SMT2, Java and Python) as inputs. The evaluation shows, across all six languages, that universal fuzzing achieves higher coverage than existing, language-specific fuzzers. Furthermore, Fuzz4All has identified 98 bugs in widely used systems, such as GCC, Clang, Z3, CVC5, OpenJDK, and the Qiskit quantum computing platform, with 64 bugs already confirmed by developers as previously unknown.",

In the computing education context, these models are being used to generate code, code explanations, and programming exercises. The rapid adoption of these models has prompted multiple position papers and workshops which discuss the implications of these models for computing education, both positive and negative. This paper presents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with 12 students and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences, and preferences regarding the use of tools powered by generative AI in computing classrooms. The results suggest that Generative AI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant role in computing education. However, students and instructors also raised numerous concerns about how these models should be integrated to best support the needs and learning goals of students. We also identified interesting tensions and alignments that emerged between how instructors and students prefer to engage with these models. We discuss these results and provide recommendations related to curriculum development, assessment methods, and pedagogical practice. As GAI tools become increasingly prevalent, it's important to understand educational stakeholders' preferences and values to ensure that these tools can be used for good and that potential harms can be mitigated.",

To address these challenges, we introduce Spellburst, a large language model (LLM) powered creative-coding environment. Spellburst provides (1) a node-based interface that allows artists to create generative art and explore variations through branching and merging operations, (2) expressive prompt-based interactions to engage in semantic programming, and (3) dynamic prompt-driven interfaces and direct code editing to seamlessly switch between semantic and syntactic exploration. Our evaluation with artists demonstrates Spellburst's potential to enhance creative coding practices and inform the design of computational creativity tools that bridge semantic and syntactic spaces.",

        "Abstract": "When trying to gain better visibility into a machine learning model in order to understand and mitigate the associated risks, a potentially valuable source of evidence is: which training examples most contribute to a given behavior? Influence functions aim to answer a counterfactual: how would the model's parameters (and hence its outputs) change if a given sequence were added to the training set? While influence functions have produced insights for small models, they are difficult to scale to large language models (LLMs) due to the difficulty of computing an inverse-Hessian-vector product (IHVP). We use the Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC) approximation to scale influence functions up to LLMs with up to 52 billion parameters. In our experiments, EK-FAC achieves similar accuracy to traditional influence function estimators despite the IHVP computation being orders of magnitude faster. We investigate two algorithmic techniques to reduce the cost of computing gradients of candidate training sequences: TF-IDF filtering and query batching. We use influence functions to investigate the generalization patterns of LLMs, including the sparsity of the influence patterns, increasing abstraction with scale, math and programming abilities, cross-lingual generalization, and role-playing behavior. Despite many apparently sophisticated forms of generalization, we identify a surprising limitation: influences decay to near-zero when the order of key phrases is flipped. Overall, influence functions give us a powerful new tool for studying the generalization properties of LLMs.",

Given the promising abilities of large language models (LLMs) in code synthesis, researchers are exploring their potential to automate code translation. The prerequisite for advancing the state of LLM-based code translation is to understand their promises and limitations over existing techniques. To that end, we present a large-scale empirical study to investigate the ability of general LLMs and code LLMs for code translation across pairs of different languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our study, which involves the translation of 1,700 code samples from three benchmarks and two real-world projects, reveals that LLMs are yet to be reliably used to automate code translation -- with correct translations ranging from 2.1% to 47.3% for the studied LLMs. Further manual investigation of unsuccessful translations identifies 15 categories of translation bugs. We also compare LLM-based code translation with traditional non-LLM-based approaches. Our analysis shows that these two classes of techniques have their own strengths and weaknesses. Finally, insights from our study suggest that providing more context to LLMs during translation can help them produce better results. To that end, we propose a prompt-crafting approach based on the symptoms of erroneous translations; this improves the performance of LLM-based code translation by 5.5% on average. Our study is the first of its kind, in terms of scale and breadth, that provides insights into the current limitations of LLMs in code translation and opportunities for improving them. Our dataset -- consisting of 1,700 code samples in five PLs with 10K+ tests, 43K+ translated code, 1,748 manually labeled bugs, and 1,365 bug-fix pairs -- can help drive research in this area.",

To support all such features, we discuss the several semantics for probabilistic logic programs that can express nondeterministic, contradictory, incomplete and/or statistical knowledge. We also discuss how gradient-based learning can be performed with neural predicates and probabilistic choices under selected semantics. We then describe an implemented package that supports inference and learning in the language, along with several example programs. The package requires minimal user knowledge of deep learning system's inner workings, while allowing end-to-end training of rather sophisticated models and loss functions.",

        "Abstract": "We present the NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK, a state-of-the-art library of composable primitives for GPU-accelerated quantum circuit simulations. As the size of quantum devices continues to increase, making their classical simulation progressively more difficult, the availability of fast and scalable quantum circuit simulators becomes vital for quantum algorithm developers, as well as quantum hardware engineers focused on the validation and optimization of quantum devices. The cuQuantum SDK was created to accelerate and scale up quantum circuit simulators developed by the quantum information science community by enabling them to utilize efficient scalable software building blocks optimized for NVIDIA GPU platforms. The functional building blocks provided cover the needs of both state vector- and tensor network- based simulators, including approximate tensor network simulation methods based on matrix product state, projected entangled pair state, and other factorized tensor representations. By leveraging the enormous computing power of the latest NVIDIA GPU architectures, quantum circuit simulators that have adopted the cuQuantum SDK demonstrate significant acceleration, compared to CPU-only execution, for both the state vector and tensor network simulation methods. Furthermore, by utilizing the parallel primitives available in the cuQuantum SDK, one can easily transition to distributed GPU-accelerated platforms, including those furnished by cloud service providers and high-performance computing systems deployed by supercomputing centers, extending the scale of possible quantum circuit simulations. The rich capabilities provided by the SDK are conveniently made available via both Python and C application programming interfaces, where the former is directly targeting a broad Python quantum community and the latter allows tight integration with simulators written in any programming language.",

        "Abstract": "Synchronous languages are now a standard industry tool for critical embedded systems. Designers write high-level specifications by composing streams of values using block diagrams. These languages have been extended with Bayesian reasoning to program state-space models which compute a stream of distributions given a stream of observations. However, the semantics of probabilistic models is only defined for scheduled equations -- a significant limitation compared to dataflow synchronous languages and block diagrams which do not require any ordering.\n  In this paper we propose two schedule agnostic semantics for a probabilistic synchronous language. The key idea is to interpret probabilistic expressions as a stream of un-normalized density functions which maps random variable values to a result and positive score. The co-iterative semantics interprets programs as state machines and equations are computed using a fixpoint operator. The relational semantics directly manipulates streams and is thus a better fit to reason about program equivalence. We use the relational semantics to prove the correctness of a program transformation required to run an optimized inference algorithm for state-space models with constant parameters.",

Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. Solutions to more complex tasks, however, are complicated through logic inconsistencies due to cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating efficient human workflows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations. MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise to verify intermediate results and reduce errors. MetaGPT utilizes an assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. On collaborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent solutions than previous chat-based multi-agent systems.

To simulate this game and attract scientists from all over the world to conduct research and participate in an annual computer-based soccer world cup, Soccer Simulation 2D (SS2D) was one of the leagues initiated in the RoboCup competition. In every SS2D game, two teams of 11 players and one coach connect to the RoboCup Soccer Simulation Server and compete against each other. Over the past few years, several C++ base codes have been employed to control agents' behavior and their communication with the server. Although C++ base codes have laid the foundation for the SS2D, developing them requires an advanced level of C++ programming. C++ language complexity is a limiting disadvantage of C++ base codes for all users, especially for beginners. To conquer the challenges of C++ base codes and provide a powerful baseline for developing machine learning concepts, we introduce Pyrus, the first Python base code for SS2D. Pyrus is developed to encourage researchers to efficiently develop their ideas and integrate machine learning algorithms into their teams.

        "Abstract": "Sub-word segmentation is an essential pre-processing step for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Existing work has shown that neural sub-word segmenters are better than Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), however, they are inefficient as they require parallel corpora, days to train and hours to decode. This paper introduces SelfSeg, a self-supervised neural sub-word segmentation method that is much faster to train/decode and requires only monolingual dictionaries instead of parallel corpora. SelfSeg takes as input a word in the form of a partially masked character sequence, optimizes the word generation probability and generates the segmentation with the maximum posterior probability, which is calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The training time of SelfSeg depends on word frequencies, and we explore several word frequency normalization strategies to accelerate the training phase. Additionally, we propose a regularization mechanism that allows the segmenter to generate various segmentations for one word. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct MT experiments in low-, middle- and high-resource scenarios, where we compare the performance of using different segmentation methods. The experimental results demonstrate that on the low-resource ALT dataset, our method achieves more than 1.2 BLEU score improvement compared with BPE and SentencePiece, and a 1.1 score improvement over Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE) and Vocabulary Learning via Optimal Transport (VOLT) on average. The regularization method achieves approximately a 4.3 BLEU score improvement over BPE and a 1.2 BLEU score improvement over BPE-dropout, the regularized version of BPE. We also observed significant improvements on IWSLT15 Vi->En, WMT16 Ro->En and WMT15 Fi->En datasets, and competitive results on the WMT14 De->En and WMT14 Fr->En datasets.",

        "Abstract": "The rise of neural network-based machine learning ushered in high-level libraries, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, to support their functionality. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) researchers have benefited from this trend and produced powerful neural networks that promise shorter simulation times. For example, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent-based (RNN) architectures can represent sub-grid physical effects, like turbulence. Implementing neural networks in CFD solvers is challenging because the programming languages used for machine learning and CFD are mostly non-overlapping, We present the roseNNa library, which bridges the gap between neural network inference and CFD. RoseNNa is a non-invasive, lightweight (1000 lines), and performant tool for neural network inference, with focus on the smaller networks used to augment PDE solvers, like those of CFD, which are typically written in C/C++ or Fortran. RoseNNa accomplishes this by automatically converting trained models from typical neural network training packages into a high-performance Fortran library with C and Fortran APIs. This reduces the effort needed to access trained neural networks and maintains performance in the PDE solvers that CFD researchers build and rely upon. Results show that RoseNNa reliably outperforms PyTorch (Python) and libtorch (C++) on MLPs and LSTM RNNs with less than 100 hidden layers and 100 neurons per layer, even after removing the overhead cost of API calls. Speedups range from a factor of about 10 and 2 faster than these established libraries for the smaller and larger ends of the neural network size ranges tested.",

        "Abstract": "Many software projects implement APIs and algorithms in multiple programming languages. Maintaining such projects is tiresome, as developers have to ensure that any change (e.g., a bug fix or a new feature) is being propagated, timely and without errors, to implementations in other programming languages. In the world of ever-changing software, using rule-based translation tools (i.e., transpilers) or machine learning models for translating code from one language to another provides limited value. Translating each time the entire codebase from one language to another is not the way developers work. In this paper, we target a novel task: translating code changes from one programming language to another using large language models (LLMs). We design and implement the first LLM, dubbed Codeditor, to tackle this task. Codeditor explicitly models code changes as edit sequences and learns to correlate changes across programming languages. To evaluate Codeditor, we collect a corpus of 6,613 aligned code changes from 8 pairs of open-source software projects implementing similar functionalities in two programming languages (Java and C#). Results show that Codeditor outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin on all commonly used automatic metrics. Our work also reveals that Codeditor is complementary to the existing generation-based models, and their combination ensures even greater performance.",

OSF logic allows the construction of record-like terms that represent classes of entities and that are themselves ordered in a subsumption relation. The unification algorithm for such structures provides an efficient calculus of type subsumption, which has been applied in computational linguistics and implemented in constraint logic programming languages such as LOGIN and LIFE and automated reasoners such as CEDAR. This work generalizes OSF logic to a fuzzy setting. We give a flexible definition of a fuzzy subsumption relation which generalizes Zadeh's inclusion between fuzzy sets. Based on this definition we define a fuzzy semantics of OSF logic where sort symbols and OSF terms denote fuzzy sets. We extend the subsumption relation to OSF terms and prove that it constitutes a fuzzy partial order with the property that two OSF terms are subsumed by one another in the crisp sense if and only if their subsumption degree is greater than 0. We show how to find the greatest lower bound of two OSF terms by unifying them and how to compute the subsumption degree between two OSF terms, and we provide the complexity of these operations.",

        "Abstract": "Operating system kernels employ virtual memory subsystems, which use a CPU's memory management units (MMUs) to virtualize the addresses of memory regions Operating systems manipulate these virtualized memory mappings to isolate untrusted processes, restrict which memory is accessible to different processes, hide memory limits from user programs, ensure process isolation, implement demand-paging and copy-on-write behaviors for performance and resource controls.\n  Virtual memory management (VMM) code is a critical piece of general-purpose OS kernels, but verification of this functionality is challenging due to the complexity of the hardware interface. In this paper, we introduce a modal abstraction to describe the truth of assertions relative to a specific virtual address space: [r]P indicating that P holds in the virtual address space rooted at r. Such modal assertions allow different address spaces to refer to each other, enabling complete verification of instruction sequences manipulating multiple address spaces. Using them effectively requires working with other assertions, such as points-to assertions in our separation logic, as relative to a given address space. We therefore define virtual points-to relations, which mimic hardware address translation, relative to a page table root. We demonstrate our approach with challenging fragments of VMM code showing that our approach handles examples beyond what prior work can address, including reasoning about a sequence of instructions as it changes address spaces. All definitions and theorems mentioned in this paper including the operational model of a RISC-like fragment of x86-64, a simple language run on this operational model, and a logic as an instantiation of the Iris framework are mechanized inside Coq.",

TEEs, like Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, allow the isolation of confidential code and data within an untrusted host environment, such as the cloud and IoT. Despite strong security guarantees, TEE adoption has been hindered by an awkward programming model. This model requires manual application partitioning and the use of error-prone, memory-unsafe, and potentially information-leaking low-level C/C++ libraries.\n  We address the above with \\textit{HasTEE}, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Haskell for programming TEE applications. HasTEE includes a port of the GHC runtime for the Intel-SGX TEE. HasTEE uses Haskell's type system to automatically partition an application and to enforce \\textit{Information Flow Control} on confidential data. The DSL, being embedded in Haskell, allows for the usage of higher-order functions, monads, and a restricted set of I/O operations to write any standard Haskell application. Contrary to previous work, HasTEE is lightweight, simple, and is provided as a \\emph{simple security library}; thus avoiding any GHC modifications.

Second, we identify and characterize potential issues with the quality of ChatGPT-generated code. Last, we provide insights into how these issues can be mitigated. Experiments highlight that out of 4,066 programs generated by ChatGPT, 2,756 programs are deemed correct, 1,082 programs provide wrong outputs, and 177 programs contain compilation or runtime errors. Additionally, we further analyze other characteristics of the generated code through static analysis tools, such as code style and maintainability, and find that 1,930 ChatGPT-generated code snippets suffer from maintainability issues. Subsequently, we investigate ChatGPT's self-repairing ability and its interaction with static analysis tools to fix the errors uncovered in the previous step. Experiments suggest that ChatGPT can partially address these challenges, improving code quality by more than 20%, but there are still limitations and opportunities for improvement.

Intuitively, the quality of naming in a program affects the performance of LLMs in program analysis tasks. This paper investigates how naming affects LLMs on code analysis tasks. Specifically, we create a set of datasets with code containing nonsense or misleading names for variables, methods, and functions, respectively. We then use well-trained models (CodeBERT) to perform code analysis tasks on these datasets. The experimental results show that naming has a significant impact on the performance of code analysis tasks based on LLMs, indicating that code representation learning based on LLMs heavily relies on well-defined names in code.

Unlike traditional program analysis-based method, this text-based approach is more general and capable of harnessing a variety of API usage information, resulting in code that is friendly for human readers. However, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the fundamental issues on this direction, such as its effectiveness and potential challenges. To bridge this gap, we conducted the first in-depth study targeting the important issues of using LLMs to generate effective fuzz drivers. Our study features a curated dataset with 86 fuzz driver generation questions from 30 widely-used C projects. Six prompting strategies are designed and tested across five state-of-the-art LLMs with five different temperature settings. In total, our study evaluated 736,430 generated fuzz drivers, with 0.85 billion token costs ($8,000+ charged tokens). Additionally, we compared the LLM-generated drivers against those utilized in industry, conducting extensive fuzzing experiments (3.75 CPU-year). Our study uncovered that: - While LLM-based fuzz driver generation is a promising direction, it still encounters several obstacles towards practical applications; - LLMs face difficulties in generating effective fuzz drivers for APIs with intricate specifics. Three featured design choices of prompt strategies can be beneficial: issuing repeat queries, querying with examples, and employing an iterative querying process; - While LLM-generated drivers can yield fuzzing outcomes that are on par with those used in the industry, there are substantial opportunities for enhancement, such as extending contained API usage, or integrating semantic oracles to facilitate logical bug detection. Our insights have been implemented to improve the OSS-Fuzz-Gen project, facilitating practical fuzz driver generation in industry.",

The presence of existential quantification in rule-heads, however, makes the main reasoning tasks undecidable. To overcome this limitation, in the last two decades, a number of classes of existential rules guaranteeing the decidability of query answering have been proposed. Unfortunately, only some of these classes fully encompass Datalog and, often, this comes at the price of higher computational complexity. Moreover, expressive classes are typically unable to exploit tools developed for classes exhibiting lower expressiveness. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel general syntactic condition that allows us to define, systematically and in a uniform way, from any decidable class $\\mathcal{C}$ of existential rules, a new class called Dyadic-$\\mathcal{C}$ enjoying the following properties: $(i)$ it is decidable; $(ii)$ it generalises Datalog; $(iii)$ it generalises $\\mathcal{C}$; $(iv)$ it can effectively exploit any reasoner for query answering over $\\mathcal{C}$; and $(v)$ its computational complexity does not exceed the highest between the one of $\\mathcal{C}$ and the one of Datalog.
